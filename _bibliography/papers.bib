	abstract = {This paper presents an approach to estimate mode-choice models from spatially anonymized revealed preference travel survey data. We propose an algorithm to find a feasible sequence of activity locations for each individual that minimizes the maximum error of each trip’s Euclidean distance within the activity chain. The synthetic activity locations are then used to create unchosen alternatives within the choice set for each individual. This is followed by the mode-choice model estimation. We test our approach on three large-scale travel surveys conducted in Switzerland, Île-de-France, and São Paulo. We find that our methodological approach can reconstruct activity locations that accurately match trip Euclidean distances but with location errors that still provide location protection. The discrete mode-choice models estimated on the synthetic locations perform similarly, in terms of goodness of fit and prediction, to the ones obtained from the observed activity locations.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
