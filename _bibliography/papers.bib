	abstract = {Futures studies concepts are complex and challenging to communicate and elaborate on. Visual artefacts exist to aid this process. Variants of futures cones, plausibility cones, or cones of possibilities are most common. Yet, the is a lack of scientific discussion and consistency. A review of what does exist can lead to a more coherent communication of concepts. This aids futures literacy and enables more targeted theoretical elaborations using the cone as an intermediary object. We pose the questions (1) how futures cones have been used so far to visualise concepts of futures studies and (2) how characteristics can be consolidated into a revised version. We compiled 14 representations and compared and analysed them. We identified and described 14 characteristics, including three shared between most cones, eight derived from existing ones, and three newly proposed ones, namely black swans, unknown unknowns, and exponential growth. This culminates in a revised futures cone that shall: (1)Act as a more accurate depiction of futures studies concepts in their uncertainty, ambiguity, and multiplicity. (2)Strengthen the applicability and understanding within and outside the futures studies field. (3)Refine the futures cones as a canvas for conceptual and theoretical discussions of futures studies concepts.},

	abstract = {Appropriate public transport systems are crucial in modern cities. Given the high costs that they represent and the impact they have on people’s lives, effective tools are required to support their design. With this in mind, the Transit Network Design problem (TNDP) and the Transit Network Design and Frequency Setting problem (TNDFSP) have been extensively studied in the domain of Operations Research. However, due to the complexity of these problems, multiple simplifications are typically made when modelling and designing solution algorithms. Therefore, still no optimization techniques are available to address these problems in practice. Moreover, different studies address different versions of the problem, with varying assumptions and constraints, complicating the comparison of results or solution approaches. This paper presents an extensive survey of studies addressing the TNDP and the TNDFSP. It discusses the different assumptions, constraints, objectives, solution approaches and testing instances that have been considered in the literature. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is done regarding the case studies considered for the TNDFSP. Moreover, the variants of the passenger assignment subproblem that have been applied within the TNDP and the TNDFSP are discussed. The analysis shows that extensive research has been done regarding these problems. However, it also identified the significant gap that still exists between theory and practice, even in the studies addressing case studies.},

Traffic congestion, higher maintenance and fuel prices, delays, accidents, and air emissions stem from the general rise in flow volume. Because of the NP-hard nature of this problem, a hidden Markov model and an Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) are employed in this paper to solve it. Each particle (solution) behaves as a search agent in EO, with its position. To reach the equilibrium condition, the search agents change their focus at random regarding the best-so-far approaches, including equilibrium candidates. A well-defined "generation rate" concept has been shown to elevate EO's capacity in avoiding local minima. This article provides a new method to lower the feasible travel time and the public travel cost using the hidden Markov model and EO algorithm. The suggested method's performance was compared to the performance of other algorithms on a test network. The related numerical outcomes show that it is more effective.},

	abstract = {The paper develops a simulation model and evaluates fixed versus on-demand operational designs of a station-based automated feeder service. The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of-service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation framework in evaluating trade-offs between fixed and on-demand service design variables and their effects on disaggregate level-of-service provided for stop-based feeder services.},

	abstract = {The continuing urbanization and corresponding increase in transport demand are putting pressure on the accessibility, safety, sustainability, livability, and efficiency of urbanized regions. Public transport is regarded as a sustainable mode of transport for these regions and therefore transport policies aim to increase its attractiveness. However, public transport is facing last-mile connectivity problems. The application of Autonomous Mobility on-Demand (AMoD) as a feeder service for public transport hubs can potentially improve the first and last-mile trip leg which increases the attractivity of public transport. However, will such a system be financially viable when applied in an urban area? and what kind of operation will lead to the highest system performance? In this research, this question is addressed by proposing a method that connects macro transport modeling and agent-based modeling (ABM). An existing gravity-based travel demand estimation model built in a macro simulation tool is used to predict passenger demand across all the OD pairs of a city. For those OD pairs that can use the AMoD as first /last mile this is modeled using an agent-based rationale to be able to simulate the behavior of passengers and vehicles within that specific area of the city. The simulation model is applied to the case study area of the south of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands, where metro Station Zuidplein and the rail Station Lombardijen function as two AMoD hubs. Using the case study, the impact of relocation, ridesharing, and charging strategy is assessed in regards to financial viability. Among other insights, results show that the AMoD service leads to a profit on a typical business day for the operating companies despite the high-quality level of the service (very low average waiting time for a vehicle). If this particular system would not consist of automated vehicles and one would have to pay a salary to drivers, it would not be possible to make a profit on a typical business day. Moreover, results show that activating dynamic ridesharing and using wireless fast chargers at the stations results in the most financially viable operation. Activating automatic relocations results in the most costly operation.},

	abstract = {Despite a wide variation in access to goods and services between rural areas, common policy interventions are often proposed in Northern Ireland. Questions remain as to the level and form of policy differentiation that is required, if any, both within and between different rural areas. This issue is investigated in this paper through the analysis of activity-travel patterns of individuals living in two rural areas with different levels of area accessibility and area mobility. Three focus groups, 299 questionnaires and 89 activity-travel diaries for 7 days were collected for individuals from these areas. Regression analyses were employed to explore the degree to which different factors influence activity-travel behaviour. The results indicate that individuals from rural areas with a higher level of accessibility are more integrated within their local community and as a result, are potentially less at risk of being excluded from society due to immobility. Differences, however, were also found between different groups within an area (e.g. non-car owning individuals who were more reliant on walking, and low-income individuals who made trips of a shorter distance). Based on the study findings and a review of existing policies, this research highlights the need to tailor policy responses to reflect the particular sets of circumstances exhibited in different areas.},

Can different patterns be observed across different space-time settings, or can common patterns be observed, largely independent from such contexts? To better understand these relationships, this paper reports on some of the findings of analyses, conducted to identify underlying structures in various aspects of travel patterns.

For both scenarios we compare a stop-based and a door-to-door service in terms of system efficiency and noise imissions, applying an updated noise prediction model in MATSim. The results contribute to the systematic analysis of ride-pooling and show the effects of the proposed policies and service designs, which are essential for an efficient system with low noise exposure. Replacing all car trips by a stop-based ride-pooling system leads to a drastic noise reduction in residential areas whereas door-to-door systems may even increase noise exposure due to additional pick-up/drop-off rides and detours.},

	abstract = {Sharing vehicles and rides may become the norm with public use of fully-automated self-driving vehicles in the near future, assuming pandemic-related health concerns fade. Dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) or ride-pooling of trips can significantly improve system performance by lowering empty vehicle-miles traveled (eVMT) and increasing average vehicle occupancy (AVO). With several cities looking to promote efficient curb space use, especially with the use of pickup and drop-off locations (PUDOs), this study explores the impacts of PUDOs on DRS rates and AVO values. Various PUDO spacings and trip-demand densities were studied, across the Bloomington, Illinois region, using the agent-based simulator POLARIS. Results reveal that greater PUDO spacing or distances between stops and higher levels of SAV use or trip demand increase AVO (by up to 20\% per 4-seater SAV, on average) and decrease SAV VMT (by up to 27\%) compared to door-to-door SAV fleet operations without DRS or PUDOs. A quarter-mile PUDO spacing is recommended in downtown regions, similar to current transit stop spacing, to keep walking trips short and demand relatively high. At 0.25 mi PUDO spacings (thoughtfully placed, using origin and destination clusters), travelers walked less than 5 min at either trip end, on average, while 0.5 mi spacings led to another 1 min (approximately) of walking. More evenly distributed and higher SAV demand can save up to 39\% total VMT from use of DRS and PUDO stops. It is also important to prepare for queuing areas at PUDOs in settings of high trip density, to limit curbside congestion.},

This paper examines the level of receptiveness of AVs while considering their adoption time, user attitudes, and their intention to share AV-trips. We explore the results of a stated-preferences survey, conducted among 600 people in Palaiseau, a city south of Paris. Collected data is analyzed using a reduced dimensional space that is dedicated to the field of multifactorial analysis (MFA) in order to apply a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and to segment the surveyed population. Five classes were identified on the basis of (i) socio-demographic criteria of the respondents; (ii) their mobility habits; and (iii) how they use AV cars. The classes were entitled: Conservatives (22\% of the sample), Sceptics (14\%), Late adopters (21\%), Early Adopters (25\%) and Explorers (18\%). The results of an economic analysis indicate the implications for operators and public policies designed to encourage optimal forms of adoption in terms of fare and level of service.},

	shorttitle = {Digital {Twins}},
	abstract = {After Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the subject of Digital Twins has emerged as another promising technology, advocated, built, and sold by various IT companies. The approach aims to produce highly realistic models of real systems. In the case of dynamically changing systems, such digital twins would have a life, i.e. they would change their behavior over time and, in perspective, take decisions like their real counterparts-so the vision. In contrast to animated avatars, however, which only imitate the behavior of real systems, like deep fakes, digital twins aim to be accurate "digital copies", i.e. "duplicates" of reality, which may interact with reality and with their physical counterparts. This chapter explores, what are possible applications and implications, limitations, and threats. Potentials Just a few years ago, producing digital twins of dynamical, perhaps even living systems, would have been considered science fiction, and an impossibility from the point of view of science. However, some people believe this situation has recently changed 1 and will do so even more in the future, particularly in view of the incredible amounts of data producible by the Internet of Things (IoT), transmittable by light-based (LiFi) and other low-latency communication systems, processible by Quantum Computers, and learnable by powerful AI systems. This data collection may be global in scale but detailed up to the level of individuals and their bodies, using profiling techniques such as those known from social media 2. The upcoming technologies are expanding current personalized devices, goods, and services to the areas of decision-making, behavior, and health. Due to miniaturization, some components will reach the sub-micrometer scale, as in the case of nanotechnology. Potentially, this enables an Internet of (Bio-)Nano-Things 3 and Internet of Bodies 4 , allowing one to (1) uniquely identify and track everybody via an e-ID, (2) read out data of body functions, and (3) manipulate body functions, supposedly to improve the health of people. As we will discuss, it is even conceivable that such powerful digital systems would be used in attempts to maximize "planetary health", considering the natural resources and ecosystems of planet Earth, while changing human behavior and civilization as desired by those who control this system. In the following, we will focus on the limitations and ethical issues of such an approach, not claiming completeness. First, we want to stress, however, that digital twin},

	abstract = {Today, a large share of cost, congestion, and emission in cities is attributed to light goods vehicles like carrier vans distributing to the last mile. The aim of many policy agendas is to reach cleaner cities with less disturbance from the distribution vehicles. Several suggestions have been put forward and tested in research and practice, such as access restrictions, multimodal transport, and use of cleaner vehicles. In this paper, we develop a case for a more sustainable freight distribution within cities using an ex ante case study. The idea of the mobile depot is built on the iteration between historical transitions within cities and contemporary developments in urban freight distribution, and then analyzed ex ante both quantitatively in calculations and qualitatively in two stakeholder workshops. The idea is integrated and multimodal, based on a mobile depot (e.g., a bus, truck, barge, or tram) that circles the city and connects to low emission last mile delivery options such as LEVs (Light Electrical Vehicles) or cargo bikes. We found that such a system can be environmentally and socially better for the city context, while maintaining economic viability above a certain utilization rate of the mobile depot for the transport operators.},

	abstract = {Public transport lines, especially train lines, have historically played an important role as economic lifelines of rural areas. They are one of the most important factors contributing to economic prosperity as they provide access to mobility for all the inhabitants of these regions. Maintaining such rural public transport lines can be a challenge due to the low utilization inherent to rural areas. Today, with the emergence of fully self-driving cars, on-demand mobility schemes in which autonomous robotic taxis transport passengers, are becoming possible. In this work, we analyze if rural public transport lines with low utilization can be replaced with autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. More specifically, we compare the existing public transportation infrastructure to hypothetical mobility-on-demand systems both in terms of cost and service level. We perform our analysis, which focuses on the operational aspects, using a simulation approach in which unit-capacity robotic taxis are operated in a street network taking into account congestion effects and state-of-the-art control (dispatching and rebalancing) strategies. Our study considers the case of four rural train lines in Switzerland that operate at low utilization and cost coverage. We show that a unit-capacity mobility-on-demand service with self-driving cars reduces both travel times and operational cost in three out of four cases. In one case, even a service with human driven vehicles would provide higher service levels at lower cost. The results suggest that centrally coordinated mobility-on-demand schemes could be a very attractive option for rural areas.},

	abstract = {The paper develops a simulation model and evaluates fixed versus on-demand operational designs of a station-based automated feeder service. The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of-service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation framework in evaluating trade-offs between fixed and on-demand service design variables and their effects on disaggregate level-of-service provided for stop-based feeder services.},

This study examines the potential performance of an Automated Demand Responsive Transport Service (ADRTS) as a replacement for scheduled bus services and simulates the effects of demand levels, vehicle capacity, vehicle dwell time and the initial vehicle distribution on system performance in terms of fleet size and system costs. The simulation tool allows simulating the operation of the ADRTS in a complete graph and is applied to the case study of Arnhem, the Netherlands. For this case study it has been shown that for a minimum fleet size following the imposed constraints, the operational costs range between 0.84 and 1.22 Euros and the average passenger wait time ranges between 2 and 6 min, according to the assumptions made on demand and operational parameters. The operational costs of the ADRTS showed to be in the same range of the current bus system, while providing a demand-responsive transport service with an average waiting time of around 4 min per passenger-trip. The economies of scale, which play an important role in public transport, are also apparent in the simulated ADRTS operations.},

An optimisation model with the objective of minimising the total travel time of passengers and the total fleet size is proposed. The terminal bus stops of regular bus lines, the service area of the DRT, and the fleet size of both regular and DRT are optimised simultaneously. A rule-based optimisation preparation step is added to the proposed model to obtain a reasonable design scheme and to reduce the computational load. The model is solved using a tailored boundary-start-based two-step heuristic algorithm. The performance of the mixed network is affected by the preference of the decision maker and the operation mode adopted for the DRT service. A reduction in the operational level of the DRT results in a considerable increase in the travel time of DRT passengers.},

This simulation study explores the potential of replacing conventional bus lines with shared autonomous vehicles in a suburban area of Berlin.

The simulation suggests for all evaluated scenarios higher operating costs and only slight travel time savings in comparison to conventional buses. Door-to-door service allows for significant reductions in average walk time, but causes numerous detours which consume a high share of the time gained.

Inter alia, increasing the use of public transport is a vital part of the current strategies. In the EU, 29\% of citizens live in rural areas, and the provision of traditional public transport in these areas is difficult and, more importantly, inefficient, further complicating its establishment. In this context, demand-responsive transport (DRT) services are presented as a possible solution. Nevertheless, scientific investigations in this domain are sparse and have fallen short of socio-scientific approaches to explain and increase the user acceptance of DRT. Against this backdrop, this systematic literature review presents an analysis of 231 articles on DRT, and a systematic identification of articles with socio-scientific approaches that were subjected to a content analysis (n = 44). This article (1) creates an overview of the development of the research field with a particular focus on user-oriented research, (2) detects a threefold, conflicting performance expectancy towards the services that complicates their success, and (3) identifies a discrepancy between the perception of DRT services and the empirical design of studies. It concludes by systemizing existing research gaps regarding performance expectation, user focus and rurality, and proposes implications for policymakers and practitioners.},

In this paper, we consider time-window access restrictions based upon the characteristics of the vehicles, and we propose a human-inthe-loop decision support system (HIL-DSS) architecture using optimization and simulation models to address the trade-off between vehicles characteristics, revenues, costs, and performance. We formulate both a deterministic and a stochastic optimization decision model addressing the problem in the context of the HILDSS. In doing this, we emphasize the role of the human decision maker in tackling a complex problem affected by variability and uncertainty, and to overcome the rigidity of optimization models thanks to the possibility to include qualitative information into the process.},

	abstract = {This paper mainly evaluates the previously published fleet planning researches which primarily utilize operations research and computational intelligence based techniques. An intermodal fleet planning framework with a classification scheme is also proposed by considering different problem/modeling characteristics, decision-making levels and multiple players or decision makers. Majority of the papers in this field generally focused on single mode fleet planning problems from the viewpoint of a single decision maker. However, there is a limited number of studies on intermodal fleet planning with multiple transport modes and resources. On the other hand, there is a strong interaction among the fleet planning components such as fleet sizing/composition, fleet deployment, fleet inventory control, empty vehicle repositioning problems etc. Nevertheless, these problems are mostly modeled and solved in a separated way in the available literature. Evaluation of the previous fleet planning researches enabled us to identify gaps in the literature and comment on the directions for future works which can lead to develop expert systems/decision support systems in the context of Logistics 4.0 for the integrated fleet planning problems with sustainability objectives under uncertain environments.},

	abstract = {Following the spread of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the role of digital technologies in manufacturing, especially in production and industrial logistics processes, has become increasingly pivotal. Although the push towards digitalization and processes interconnection can bring substantial beneﬁts, it may also increase the complexity of processes in terms of integration and management. To fully exploit the potential of technology, companies are required to develop an in-depth knowledge of each operational activity and related human aspects in the contexts where technology solutions can be implemented. Indeed, analyzing the impacts of technology on human work is key to promoting human-centred smart manufacturing and logistics processes. Therefore, this paper aims at increasing and systematizing knowledge about technologies supporting internal logistics working activities The main contribution of this paper is a taxonomy of the technologies that may be implemented in the different internal logistics areas to support a Logistics 4.0 model. Such a contribution is elaborated in accordance with a deductive approach (i.e., reasoning from the particular to the general), and backed up by an analysis of the literature. The taxonomy represents a useful framework to understand the current and possible technological implementations to drive logistics processes towards Logistics 4.0, with speciﬁc attention to the relation between human operators and technologies.},

	abstract = {Logistics and supply chain management have always been at the forefront of industrial innovations, and numerous technologies have been tested and applied with success to increase efficiency of processes, reduce costs, or improve the relationships among different actors, such as buyers, sellers, retailers and carriers. In recent times, there is a great debate in both practitioners and academic’ worlds about the impacts of these new technologies on the traditional logistic operations. The perspective of extant literature on technology adoption in logistics is quite fragmented: in fact, a stream of literature studies how a technology might provide improvements in logistics processes (e.g. warehouse management, goods distribution) and/or logistics management objectives (e.g. warehouse efficiency), while other research works focus on the impact of technology adoption in terms of overall business performance. Moreover, despite the amount of articles, reports and news regarding innovations in logistics, one of the last literature review about existing technologies applied in logistics has been published almost ten years ago and it is limited only to ICT technologies. Therefore, we reckon the need for an updated view on the literature in this field. Through a systematic literature review, we try to give an answer to the following research questions: i) how the interest in this topic changed in the last ten years from the point of view of scientific literature; ii) what are the main approaches and methodologies used in addressing this issue; iii) what are the most applied innovative technologies in the logistics field.},

In these urban terminals, freight flows from interurban carriers are consolidated and transferred to a neutral last-mile carrier to perform final deliveries. This operation would reduce both last-mile fleet size and average distance cost. Our UCC modeling approach is focused on continuous analytic models for the general case of carriers with different market shares. Savings are highly sensitive to the design of the system: the increment of capacity in interurban vehicles and the proximity of the UCC terminal to the area in relation to current distribution centers. An exhaustive collection of possible market shares distributions are discussed. Results show that market shares distribution does not affect cost savings significantly. The analysis of the proposed model also highlights the trade-off between savings in the system and a minimum market share per company when the consolidation center is established.},

The current system without consolidation center is compared in terms of operational costs with a future system where a consolidation center is implemented. Continuous analysis is used to formulate a basic model to estimate costs and benefits. Finally, general results are discussed and a case study in L’Hospitalet de Llobregat (Metropolitan Area of Barcelona) is analyzed. Results are promising with a 12-14\% of operational cost savings in a general case. From the case study we conclude that the commitment of the 40\% of demand allows covering the costs of terminal implantation.},

We assume customers are distributed over a circular service region partitioned into zones, each of which is serviced by a single vehicle. The routing costs are assessed through a continuous approximation model.

	abstract = {Multi-agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging industrial problem where a team of robots is tasked with transporting a set of tasks, each from an initial location and each to a specified target location. Appearing in the context of automated warehouse logistics and automated mail sortation, MAPD requires first deciding which robot is assigned what task (i.e., Task Assignment or TA) followed by a subsequent coordination problem where each robot must be assigned collision-free paths so as to successfully complete its assignment (i.e., Multi-Agent Path Finding or MAPF). Leading methods in this area solve MAPD sequentially: first assigning tasks, then assigning paths. In this work we propose a new coupled method where task assignment choices are informed by actual delivery costs instead of by lower-bound estimates. The main ingredients of our approach are a marginal-cost assignment heuristic and a meta-heuristic improvement strategy based on Large Neighbourhood Search. As a further contribution, we also consider a variant of the MAPD problem where each robot can carry multiple tasks instead of just one. Numerical simulations show that our approach yields efficient and timely solutions and we report significant improvement compared with other recent methods from the literature.},

	abstract = {We study the ofﬂine Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) problem, where a team of agents has to execute a batch of tasks with release times in a known environment. To execute a task, an agent has to move ﬁrst from its current location to the pickup location of the task and then to the delivery location of the task. The MAPD problem is to assign tasks to agents and plan collision-free paths for them to execute their tasks. Online MAPD algorithms can be applied to the ofﬂine MAPD problem, but do not utilize all of the available information and may thus not be effective. Therefore, we present two novel ofﬂine MAPD algorithms that improve a state-of-the-art online MAPD algorithm with respect to task planning, path planning, and deadlock avoidance for the ofﬂine MAPD problem. Our MAPD algorithms ﬁrst compute one task sequence for each agent by solving a special traveling salesman problem and then plan paths according to these task sequences. We also introduce an effective deadlock avoidance method, called “reserving dummy paths.” Theoretically, our MAPD algorithms are complete for well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of all MAPD instances. Experimentally, they produce solutions of smaller makespans and scale better than the online MAPD algorithm in simulated warehouses with hundreds of robots and thousands of tasks.},

	abstract = {In a floor warehouse environment, where many agents transport numbers of products iteratively, efficient product transportation is required for high productivity. In general, the following facts are recognized. (i) Three kinds of jobs exist: picking, replenishment and arrangement. (ii) Mixed-load transportation can decrease the completion time of vehicles. In many former methods, however, the above facts are not considered. We propose a design methodology using a dispatching rule and a local search method based on a simulated annealing algorithm. The rule is applied to obtain the initial solution and the local search method is adopted to obtain a semi-optimal solution in consideration of mixed-load transportation. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, we have implemented the algorithm in several product environments. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider a fleet of self-driving cars operating in a road network governed by rules of the road, such as the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, providing rides to customers to serve their demands with desired deadlines. We focus on the associated motion planning problem that trades-off the demands' delays and level of violation of the rules of the road to achieve social optimum among the vehicles. Due to operating in the same environment, the interaction between the cars must be taken into account, and can induce further delays. We propose an integrated route and motion planning approach that achieves scalability with respect to the number of cars by resolving potential collision situations locally within so-called bubble spaces enclosing the conflict. The algorithms leverage the road geometries, and perform joint planning only for lead vehicles in the conflict and use queue scheduling for the remaining cars. Furthermore, a framework for storing previously resolved conflict situations is proposed, which can be use for quick querying of joint motion plans. We show the mobility-on-demand setup and effectiveness of the proposed approach in simulated case studies involving up to 10 self-driving vehicles.},

	abstract = {In Europe, one of the instruments at the Network Manager’s (NM) disposal to tackle demand-capacity imbalance is to impose ground, i.e. Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM), delays to flights. To compensate for anticipated delays and improve on-time performance, Aircraft Operators usually embed a buffer time in their schedules. The current practice for allocating ATFM delays does not take into account if flights have any remaining schedule buffer to absorb ATFM delay and reduce delay propagation to subsequent flights. Furthermore, the policy presently employed is to minimize ATFM delays, an order of magnitude of half a minute per flight, while propagated delays are approximately ten times higher. In this paper, we explore the possibility to control ATFM delay distribution in a way so as to minimize delay propagated to subsequent flights, but also to increase flights’ adherence to airport slots at coordinated airports. To this aim, we propose a two-level mixed-integer optimization model to solve en-route demand-capacity imbalance problem and further improve airport slot adherence. The rationales behind the research are drawn from practical experience, while the model proposed is compatible with the one currently being used by the NM, making it easy to implement. We test the model on two real-world case studies and conduct ex post analysis to test the effects of violation of model assumptions on results. The results show that it is possible to use the proposed methodology to lower delay propagated to subsequent flights and at the same time to improve airport slot adherence. In addition, they suggest that the current regulatory settings aiming to minimize ATFM delay minutes, as well as operational implementation thereof, are neither necessarily fully aligned with the desires and operating goals of Aircraft Operators, nor they improve the predictability of operations in the network.},

In the case of a single constrained en-route sector or airport, we propose a mechanism for slot allocation which is based on market principles as it enables airlines to pay for delay reduction or receive compensation for delay increase. The mechanism fulfills the properties of individual rationality, budget balance, coalitional rationality and Pareto efficiency, and it can be implemented through two alternative distributed approaches that do not require airlines to disclose confidential information. Both approaches have the additional advantage that they directly involve airlines in the decision making process. Two computational examples relying on real data indicate that the market-based solution allows the participating airlines to significantly decrease their overall delay-related costs with respect to the First Planned First Served allocation.},

Through the rediscovery of personalized air travel and novel technologies such autonomous flight and electric propulsion it is anticipated by some to bring a transport revolution in the form of flying taxis. UAM in its extent is a young field and therefore a lot of research potential can be found. To handle this new and vast system a categorization into seven fields is undertaken in this paper: air traffic management, infrastructure, markets, operators, passengers, the public, and vehicles. First results from a literature review indicate an emphasize on vehicles and a neglecting of operations. For further investigation a Python-based tool for keyword clustering and quantitative literature analysis is introduced which serves to identify and categorize research gaps systematically. The goal of this paper is to structure the system of UAM on a top layer and create a reference point for ongoing efforts. The hope of the author is that through this structure definitions of Concept of Operations for UAM become more meaningful and less redundant. A generic approach for development of Concept of Operations for UAM is presented and guidelines for a structured workflow are given. This approach contains of the formulation of the research question, identification of the relevant stakeholders and their interactions, and a description of the flow of actions and decision.},

First, efficient CPS data collection: when limited communication bandwidth meets numerous CPS devices, we need to make more effort to study efficient wireless communication scheduling strategies. Second, accurate and robust localization: localization is the basis for many fundamental operations in smart warehouses, but still needs to be improved from various aspects like accuracy and robustness. Third, human activity recognition: human activity recognition can be applied in human–computer interaction for remote machine operations. Fourth, multi-robot collaboration: smart robots will take the place of humans to accomplish most tasks particularly in a harsh environment, and smart and fully-distributed robot collaborating algorithms should be investigated. Finally, we point out some challenging issues in the future CPS-based smart warehouse, which could open some new research directions.},

But the concurrent utilization of an intersection is an important feature needed in reality. This paper proposes new auction-based intersectioncontrol mechanisms allowing for concurrency. Their design has been challenging due to complex traffic-specific requirements like the high number of agents involved or varying space and time consumption of vehicles crossing the intersection. Experiments show that they yield a significantly higher degree of overall driver satisfaction than state-of-the-art mechanisms.},

In order to enhance first-in, first-out property (FIFO) and transmission function in the multiclass traffic modeling, a new multiclass cell transmission model with FIFO property (herein called FM-CTM) is extended from its prior multiclass cell transmission model (M-CTM). Also, to enhance its analytical compactness and resultant computational convenience, FM-CTM is formulated in this paper asa set of closed-form matrix equations. The objective is to improve the accuracy of traffic state estimation by enforcing FIFO property when a fast vehicle cannot overtake a slow vehicle due to a limitation of a single-lane road. Moreover, the proposed model takes into account a different priority for vehicles of each class to move forward through congested road conditions, and that makes the flow calculation independent from their free-flow speeds. Some hypothetical and real-world freeway networks with a constant or varying number of lanes are selected to verify FM-CTM by comparing with M-CTM and the conventional CTM. Observed densities of VISSIM and real-world dataset of I-80 are selected to compare with the simulated densities from the three CTMs. The numerical results show that FM-CTM outperforms the other two models by 15\% of accuracy measures in most cases. Therefore, the proposed model is expected to be well applicable to the road network with a mixed traffic and varying number of lanes.},

Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can improve traffic efficiency, increase safety, and reduce the negative environmental impacts through effective communication and control. Therefore, to improve the traffic efficiency and reduce the fuel consumption in on-ramp scenarios, this paper addresses the global and optimal coordination of the CAVs in a merging zone. Herein, a cooperative multi-player game-based optimization framework and an algorithm are presented to coordinate vehicles and achieve minimum values for the global pay-off conditions. Fuel consumption, passenger comfort, and travel time within the merging control zone were used as the pay-off conditions. After analyzing the characteristics of the merging control zone and selecting the appropriate control decision duration, multi-player games were decomposed into multiple two-player games. An optimal merging strategy was, thereby, derived from a pay-off matrix, and minimum payoffs were predicted for a number of different potential strategies. The optimal trajectory corresponding to the predicted minimum payoffs was then utilized as the control law to coordinate the vehicles merging. The proposed control scheme derives an optimal merging sequence and an optimal trajectory for each vehicle. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through simulation. The proposed controller is compared with two alternative methods to demonstrate its potential to reduce fuel consumption and travel time and to improve passenger comfort and traffic efficiency.},

The introduction of Ultra Large Containerships results in a much larger number of containers stowed in a cargo bay. The objective of this paper is to determine the impact of the increasing containership bay size on the economies of scale at berth. We develop the concept of bay time, the amount of time it takes to load and discharge the largest cargo bay of a containership based on bay size, in order to determine the minimum amount of time it takes to discharge and load a containership. The analysis establishes that bay time is the foundation and critical path of the minimum amount of time a containership must stay at berth and in port. The study notes that, inherently, an increase in containership bay size involves diseconomies of scale in cargo handling operations, at a given level of gantry crane productivity. We find that there are increasing diseconomies of scale for large containerships at berth. The study also establishes that: as beam/bay size increases, the average cargo handling time of two bays increases by an average of 4.5 h at any productivity level. Bay time declines as crane productivity increases up to the crane’s technological constraint. Furthermore, the larger the beam/bay, the larger the marginal benefits when productivity increases. The diseconomies of scale are stable and predictable at every gantry crane productivity level. The study recommends using bay time as the fundamental measure for containership performance at berth and in port, as well as for voyage planning.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an online charge scheduling strategy for fleets of autonomous-mobility-on-demand electric vehicles (AMoD EVs). We consider the case where vehicles complete trips and then enter a between-ride state throughout the day, with their information becoming available to the fleet operator in an online fashion. In the between-ride state, the vehicles must be scheduled for charging and then routed to their next passenger pick-up locations. Additionally, due to the unknown daily sequences of ride requests, the problem cannot be solved by any offline approach. As such, we study an online welfare maximization heuristic based on primal-dual methods that allocates limited fleet charging resources and rebalances the vehicles while avoiding congestion at charging facilities and pick-up locations. We discuss a competitive ratio result comparing the performance of our online solution to the clairvoyant offline solution and provide numerical results highlighting the performance of our heuristic.},

Meanwhile, battery swapping could become a promising approach to sustain the efficient operation of EV fleet. This article proposes a combined operation scheme for battery swapping station (BSS) and AMoD system. To maximizing the profit of AMoD system, an expanded network flow model is employed to determine swapping scheduling and vehicle rebalancing for EV fleet in AMoD system. The interaction between the shared mobility-on-demand system and BSS is modeled by the swapping demand and swapping price. Specifically, swapping demand is determined in the AMoD system and introduced as known parameters in the BSS problem. Fleet management operation in AMoD system will be influenced by swapping price provided by BSS. The BSS management problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, which optimizes refueling decisions for depleted batteries. Simulation experiments based on real-world data from New York City are provided. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed integrated operation model.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs), but in particular shared autonomous transit on demand (ATOD), promises many efficiencies in future transport provision, and may lead to concomitant changes in urban form. Considering the effects of car-oriented planning on the livability, efficiency and sustainability of 20th century cities, there is growing interest in how we may anticipate the changes that this disruption will bring about. Parking and pick-up drop-off infrastructures are some of the several aspects which may change travel behaviour in the upcoming era of AVs. In the paper, three different parking strategies as well as four types of pick-up drop-off infrastructures are simulated to assess their influence in users and operators. The studied parking strategies include demand-based roaming, parking on the street and parking in depots. The four types of pick-up drop-off interfaces are infinity bay, demand-based bay, curbside and single vehicle. The proposed fleet include 3 vehicle sizes: 4-, 10- and 20-seaters for sharing mobility, and 1-seaters for private mobility. Combinations of different parking strategies and different pick-up drop-off infrastructures were evaluated from the perspective of travel time, walk distance, vehicle occupancy, rejected requests and vehicle kilometers traveled. Results show that strategies produce radically different utilization of vehicles to provide the same minimum service level for a particular study area in Singapore. We conclude that urban designers and policy-makers need to consider these as important parameters when designing or retrofitting neighborhoods if they want to maximize potential benefits from this new transportation mode.},

We perform a set of simulation driven feasibility and scalability analyses based on UAM operational models with the goal of estimating capacity and throughput for a given set of parameters that represent an operational UAM ecosystem. UAM ecosystem design guidelines, vehicle constraints, and effective operational policies can be drawn from our analysis. Results show that, while critical for enabling UAM, the performance of the UAM ecosystem is robust to variations in ground infrastructure and fleet design decisions, while being sensitive to decisions for fleet and traffic management policies. We show that so long as the ecosystem design parameters for ground infrastructure and fleet design fall within a sensible range, the performance of the UAM ecosystem is affected by the policies used to manage the UAM traffic.},

There is a dearth of knowledge among users with different abilities and needs. Hence, this study addresses this gap by investigating user acceptance of shared AVs among people with different mobility and communication needs in Singapore. Understanding the perspectives of these users is critical to ensure that shared AVs services are inclusive, aiding in acceptance. The groups studied are the 1) blind and visually impaired; 2) deaf and hard of hearing; 3) individuals using mobility aids, such as wheelchair, scooter, or cane; 4) individuals with autism and their caregivers; 5) families with young children and pregnant women; 6) seniors (age 60 + ). Using an online survey (n = 300) and focus group discussions (n = 53), we found that these user groups are (i) anticipating AV in public transport with positive attitudes and emotions, and (ii) generally concerned about various aspects of safety. AV service safety and reliability are ranked as top concerns across all groups surveyed. Users who are likely to require onboard assistance prioritised ease of boarding and alighting, and all groups ranked the presence of ‘onboard service staff’ as less important. Participants identified several important service features, such as onboard safety features - especially a ‘live’ intercom, and auditory and visual cues for visually impaired and hard of hearing. Some users would also like dedicated lanes for AVs. Inclusive experiential rides on an AV will help members of these groups feel more comfortable and prepared for AVs once deployed.},

This study couples charging and repositioning events as a means of improving service quality (rider wait times), reducing empty travel due to repositioning or charging, and improving fleet utilization (average daily trips per vehicle and charging queues). This synergy is explored for the Austin, Texas region using POLARIS, an agent-based model. On average, wait times were 39\% lower, and average daily trips served per SAEV increased up to 6.4 (or 28\%) compared to SAEV repositioning with heuristic charging. Coupling repositioning with charging decreased the fleet's percent empty travel on average by 1.6\%, relative to the scenario treating them as independent events (which varies by charging station design). Sparser charging stations reduce investment costs, and operators can leverage this framework to keep traveler wait times low.},

Transport users’ travel behavior is fixed and the operator is enabled to adjust the ride-hailing vehicle fleet size to keep 90\% of all waiting times below 10 minutes. The results show that the trip density has a major impact on the required ride-hailing fleet size as well as the resulting service (e.g. operation hours, vehicle-kilometers and pooling rate). The simulation results reveal a nonlinear relationship of trip density and ride-hailing service parameters. A linear upscaling of simulation results for a small population sample may yield an overestimation of the fleet size, operating hours and vehicle kilometers. For low trip densities, the effect of pooling (ride-sharing) is disproportionately smaller compared to larger trip densities.},

MATSim (Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation) is the only high-resolution spatially-explicit framework that allows intrinsic population downscaling - simulating the entire system's dynamics based only on a fraction k of the traveling population. Till now, the choice of k was dictated by hardware performance, and a common rule was not to downscale below 10\%. We investigate downscaling in MATSim by comparing the aggregate and disaggregate statistics that describe the dynamics of car traffic in full-scaled and downscaled simulations of the Sioux Falls test case road network. Simulations with 25\% or higher shares of the traveler population preserve all major urban traffic statistics. Within the 10–25\% interval, downscaling becomes unstable for some of the statistics. For scenarios that are downscaled 10\% and below, statistics can substantially deviate from the full-scale model. We further discuss the problems related to a multimodal transportation simulation's downscaling that also includes public transportation.},

As large-scale simulations require substantial computational power and have long run times, most often a sample of the full population and downscaled road capacities are used as simulation inputs, and then the simulation outcomes are scaled up. Using a massively parallelized mobility model on a large-scale test case of the whole of Switzerland, which includes 3.5 million private vehicles and 1.7 million users of public transit, we have systematically quantified, from 6 105 simulations of a weekday, the impacts of scaled input data on simulation outputs. We show, from simulations with population samples ranging from 1\% to 100\% of the full population and corresponding scaling of the traffic network, that the simulated traffic dynamics are driven primarily by the flow capacity, rather than the spatial properties, of the traffic network. Using a new measure of traffic similarity, that is based on the chi-squared test statistic, it is shown that the dynamics of the vehicular traffic and the occupancy of the public transit are adversely impacted when population samples less than 30\% of the full population are used. Moreover, we present evidence that the adverse impact of population sampling is determined mostly by the patterns of the agents’ behaviour rather than by the traffic model.},

In this study, we investigate the impacts of population downscaling on a ride-sharing service with a focus on vehicle occupancy and wait time, travel time and detour time. Our findings reveal that if transport modelers want to model on-demand services with ride sharing, it is strongly recommended to use a 100\% population, or when using a smaller population sample, to estimate the relative biases of their desired metrics compared to the results of a 100\% population in order for their results to be applicable for real-world situations.},

In addition to the road freight flows in tons as well as number of vehicles, the dataset also contains the shortest path between the respective regions on the European highway network (E-roads). Fifteen columns provide the following information for each pair of regions: (1) ID origin region, (2) name origin region, (3) ID destination region, (4) name destination region, (5) path in the E-road network, (6) distance from origin region to the E-road network, (7) distance within the E-road network, (8) distance from the E-road network to the destination region, (9) total distance, (10) road freight flow in tons for 2010, (11) road freight flow in tons for 2019, (12) road freight flow in tons for 2030, (13) truck traffic flow in number of vehicles for 2010, (14) truck traffic flow in number of vehicles for 2019, (15) truck traffic flow in number of vehicles for 2030. In addition, a table of nodes and a table of edges of the modelled E-road network is available. Finally, a list with supplementary information on the regions under consideration is given. In 2010, the ETISplus project collected Europe-wide freight volumes from various EU sources as well as from the EU countries and calibrated the resulting origin-destination matrices with measured traffic flows. For the dataset described here, the road freight volume was updated using Eurostat data and a forecast up to 2030 was added. The freight volume was converted into vehicles travelling. Subsequently, the highway network relevant for trucks was extracted from the ETISplus project and manually updated with the current E-road network. Finally, each origin-destination freight volume was allocated to the network using Dijkstra's algorithm. This provides a synthetically generated road freight traffic volume for each road section. The generated data provide an extremely relevant basis for the design of future road infrastructure in Europe, for example hydrogen refuelling stations or charging stations for electric trucks. Thus, the data are not only relevant for traffic science studies, but also of high importance for planners in practice.},

	abstract = {Large ride-hailing platforms, such as DiDi, Uber and Lyft, connect tens of thousands of vehicles in a city to millions of ride demands throughout the day, providing great promises for improving transportation efficiency through the tasks of order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. Existing studies, however, usually consider the two tasks in simplified settings that hardly address the complex interactions between the two, the real-time fluctuations between supply and demand, and the necessary coordinations due to the large-scale nature of the problem. In this paper we propose a unified value-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both tasks. At the center of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated continuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform transactions. To improve the sample-efficiency and the robustness, we further propose a novel periodic ensemble method combining the fast online learning with a large-scale offline training scheme that leverages the abundant historical driver trajectory data. This allows the proposed framework to adapt quickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent patterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed vehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably improvements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks. Particularly, V1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning tracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results on improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.},

	abstract = {In this study, a real-time dispatching algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed and for the first time, is deployed in large scale. Current dispatching methods in ridehailing platforms are dominantly based on myopic or rule-based non-myopic approaches. Reinforcement learning enables dispatching policies that are informed of historical data and able to employ the learned information to optimize returns of expected future trajectories. Previous studies in this field yielded promising results, yet have left room for further improvements in terms of performance gain, self-dependency, transferability, and scalable deployment mechanisms. The present study proposes a standalone RL-based dispatching solution that is equipped with multiple mechanisms to ensure robust and efficient on-policy learning and inference while being adaptable for full-scale deployment. A new form of value updating based on temporal difference is proposed that is more adapted to the inherent uncertainty of the problem. For the driver-order assignment, a customized utility function is proposed that when tuned based on the statistics of the market, results in remarkable performance improvement and interpretability. In addition, for reducing the risk of cancellation after drivers' assignment, an adaptive graph pruning strategy based on the multi-arm bandit problem is introduced. The method is evaluated using offline simulation with real data and yields notable performance improvement. In addition, the algorithm is deployed online in multiple cities under DiDi's operation for A/B testing and is launched in one of the major international markets as the primary mode of dispatch. The deployed algorithm shows over 1.3\% improvement in total driver income from A/B testing. In addition, by causal inference analysis, as much as 5.3\% improvement in major performance metrics is detected after full-scale deployment.},

	abstract = {Mobility on demand (MoD) systems show great promise in realizing flexible and efficient urban transportation. However, significant technical challenges arise from operational decision making associated with MoD vehicle dispatch and fleet rebalancing. For this reason, operators tend to employ simplified algorithms that have been demonstrated to work well in a particular setting. To help bridge the gap between novel and existing methods, we propose a modular framework for fleet rebalancing based on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) that can leverage an existing dispatch method to minimize system cost. In particular, by treating dispatch as part of the environment dynamics, a centralized agent can learn to intermittently direct the dispatcher to reposition free vehicles and mitigate against fleet imbalance. We formulate RL state and action spaces as distributions over a grid partitioning of the operating area, making the framework scalable and avoiding the complexities associated with multiagent RL. Numerical experiments, using real-world trip and network data, demonstrate that RL reduces waiting time by 28\% to 38\% for the same-day evaluation, 17\% to 44\% for cross-day evaluation, and 22\% to 25\% for cross-season evaluation compared with no rebalancing scenarios. This approach has several distinct advantages over baseline methods including: improved system cost; high degree of adaptability to the selected dispatch method; and the ability to perform scale-invariant transfer learning between problem instances with similar vehicle and request distributions.},

	abstract = {In a ride-hailing system, an optimal relocation of vacant vehicles can significantly reduce fleet idling time and balance the supply-demand distribution, enhancing system efficiency and promoting driver satisfaction and retention. Model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to dynamically learn the relocating policy by actively interacting with the intrinsic dynamics in large-scale ride-hailing systems. However, the issues of sparse reward signals and unbalanced demand and supply distribution place critical barriers in developing effective DRL models. Conventional exploration strategy (e.g., the \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-greedy) may barely work under such an environment because of dithering in low-demand regions distant from high-revenue regions. This study proposes the deep relocating option policy (DROP) that supervises vehicle agents to escape from oversupply areas and effectively relocate to potentially underserved areas. We propose to learn the Laplacian embedding of a time-expanded relocation graph, as an approximation representation of the system relocation policy. The embedding generates task-agnostic signals, which in combination with task-dependent signals, constitute the pseudo-reward function for generating DROPs. We present a hierarchical learning framework that trains a high-level relocation policy and a set of low-level DROPs. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a custom-built high-fidelity simulator with real-world trip record data. We report that DROP significantly improves baseline models with 15.7\% more hourly revenue and can effectively resolve the dithering issue in low-demand areas.},

	abstract = {Current mobility services cannot compete on equal terms with self-owned mobility products concerning service quality. Because of supply and demand imbalances, ridesharing users invariably experience delays, price surges, and rejections. Traditional approaches often fail to respond to demand fluctuations adequately because service levels are, to some extent, bounded by fleet size. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, however, the characteristics of mobility services change and new opportunities to overcome the prevailing limitations arise. In this paper, we consider an autonomous ridesharing problem in which idle vehicles are hired on-demand in order to meet the service-level requirements of a heterogeneous user base. In the face of uncertain demand and idle vehicle supply, we propose a learning-based optimization approach that uses the dual variables of the underlying assignment problem to iteratively approximate the marginal value of vehicles at each time and location under different availability settings. These approximations are used in the objective function of the optimization problem to dispatch, rebalance, and occasionally hire idle third-party vehicles in a high-resolution transportation network of Manhattan, New York City. The results show that the proposed policy outperforms a reactive optimization approach in a variety of vehicle availability scenarios while hiring fewer vehicles. Moreover, we demonstrate that mobility services can offer strict service-level contracts to different user groups featuring both delay and rejection penalties.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an adaptive model-free deep reinforcement approach that can recognize and adapt to the diurnal patterns in the ride-sharing environment with car-pooling. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to being agnostic to the timescale of changes in the distribution of experiences. Although RL algorithms are guaranteed to converge to optimal policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs), this only holds in the presence of static environments. However, this assumption is very restrictive. In many real-world problems like ride-sharing, traffic control, etc., we are dealing with highly dynamic environments, where RL methods yield only sub-optimal decisions. To mitigate this problem in highly dynamic environments, we (1) adopt an online Dirichlet change point detection (ODCP) algorithm to detect the changes in the distribution of experiences, (2) develop a Deep Q Network (DQN) agent that is capable of recognizing diurnal patterns and making informed dispatching decisions according to the changes in the underlying environment. Rather than fixing patterns by time of week, the proposed approach automatically detects that the MDP has changed, and uses the results of the new model. In addition to the adaptation logic in dispatching, this paper also proposes a dynamic, demand aware vehicle-passenger matching and route planning framework that dynamically generates optimal routes for each vehicle based on online demand, vehicle capacities, and locations. Evaluation on New York City Taxi public dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach in improving the fleet utilization, where less than 50\% of the fleet are utilized to serve the demand of up to 90\% of the requests, while maximizing profits and minimizing idle times.},

However, it still remains a challenging issue to coordinate ride-sourcing and public transit services through real-time order dispatching. In this paper, we model the order dispatching in a multi-modal transportation system as a large-scale sequential decision-making problem. A centralized algorithm is then proposed to dispatch idle drivers to arriving passenger orders and determine whether to advise passengers to use a combined mode of ride-sourcing and public transit services (if yes, the algorithm also needs to recommend an appropriate transportation hub). In particular, our proposed algorithm contains a reinforcement learning approach that estimates the long-term expected rewards, and an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that matches idle drivers and waiting passengers in real-time based on both immediate revenue and the estimated long-term rewards. By evaluation on the real-world on-demand data and metro system in Manhattan, the proposed method shows remarkable improvement on the system’s efficiency under different density of supply and demands.},

The simulator and the vehicle dispatching algorithm are designed based on industrial-scale real-world data and the workflow of online ride-hailing platforms, ensuring the practical value of our approach. Besides, the vehicle dispatching problem is translated in analogy with the load balancing problem in computer networks. Inspired by the recommendation system, the problem of high concurrency of dispatching requests is addressed by sorting the actions as a recommendation list, whereby matching action with requests. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to existing benchmarks. It is also worth noting that the proposed approach won first place in the vehicle dispatching task of KDD Cup 2020.},

In particular, we propose an actor-critic algorithm with feed-forward neural networks as approximations of both policy and value functions, where the policy function provides the optimal dispatch strategy and the value function estimates the expected costs at each time stamp. Our numerical studies show that the algorithm converges to the theoretical upper bound with less than 4\% optimality gap, whether the system dynamics are deterministic or stochastic. We also investigate the scenario where we consider user priority and fairness, and the results indicate that our learned policy is capable of producing a superior strategy that balances equity, cancellation, and level of service when user priority is considered.},

	abstract = {In recent years, mobility on demand has experienced a major revival due to various ride-hailing companies entering the market. Competing in this field requires an efficient operation. Therefore, the applied policy, which cares for vehicle-to-customer assignment and vehicle repositioning, has to achieve good customer service and minimize cost while trying to keep the impact on the environment as low as possible. A promising approach is to coordinate the control of the entire fleet, which is foreseen to become even easier with the possibility of autonomous vehicles in mind. Anticipating future demand requires a good understanding of the spatiotemporal distributions of request origins and destinations, and the resulting imbalance between vehicle demand and availability. This results from a multitude of topological, demographic, and social effects, which are almost impossible to sufficiently capture in a handcrafted model of reasonable complexity. This can be circumvented by leveraging machine learning approaches. In this paper, an image-like representation of the city and its fleet's state is introduced. It is comprehensive and intuitive to use as input to convolutional neural networks, which in the past have already been proven to capture spatial relationships very well. This allows operating on realistic, full-sized traffic networks without greatly increasing the number of parameters the neural network has to learn and, hence, keeps the training effort low. Additionally, this state is combined with a similarly constructed repositioning action, reflecting a 2D distribution of a well-performing operational policy. This approach allows replacement of complex, handcrafted mathematical models by a single, compact, auto-encoder-like neural network.},

	abstract = {The optimal routing of a single vacant taxi is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem to account for profit maximization over a full working period in a transportation network. A batch offline reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to learn action values and the optimal policy from archived trajectory data. The method is model-free, in that no state transition model is needed. It is more efficient than the commonly used online RL methods based on interactions with a simulator, due to batch processing and reuse of transition experiences. The batch RL method is evaluated in a large network of Shanghai, China with GPS trajectories of over 12,000 taxis. The training is conducted with two datasets: one is a synthetic dataset where state transitions are generated in a simulator with a postulated system dynamics model (Yu et al., 2019) whose parameters are derived from observed data; the other contains real-world state transitions extracted from observed taxi trajectories. The batch RL method is more computationally efficient, reducing the training time by dozens of times compared with the online Q-learning method. Its performance in terms of average profit per hour and occupancy rate is assessed in the simulator, against that of a baseline model, the random walk, and an upper bound, generated by the exact Dynamic Programming (DP) method based on the same system model of the simulator. The batch RL based on simulated and observed trajectories both outperform the random walk, and the advantage increases with the training sample size. The batch RL based on simulated trajectories achieves 95\% of the performance upper bound with 30-minutes time intervals, suggesting that the model-free method is highly effective. The batch RL based on observed data achieves around 90\% of the performance upper bound with 30-minute time intervals, due to the discrepancy between the training and evaluation environments, and its performance in the real world is expected to similarly good since the training and evaluation would be based on the same environment.},

Most existing surveys study how a particular challenge is addressed using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimisation techniques. However, these surveys fail to address the crucial “Whole System Design” point of view, which includes the “whole system” of interconnected stakeholders, entities, and subsystems that participate in, impact, and influence the success of each other and system a whole. Such a survey is highly required with the growing demand for flexible SMS that supports autonomous decision-making and offers multi-modal and inter-operable transportation services catered for highly dynamic traffic conditions in urban areas.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the taxi fleet dispatch problem, which is critical for many transport service platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing. We focus on maximizing the revenue and profit a taxi platform can generate through the dispatch approaches designed with various criteria. We consider determining the proportion of taxi fleets to different destination zones given the expected rewards from the future states following the distribution decisions learned through reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We also take into account more straightforward greedy algorithms that look ahead fewer decision time steps in the future. Our dispatch decision algorithms commonly leverage contextual information and heuristics using a data structure called Contextual Matching Matrix (CMM). The key contribution of our paper is the insight into the trade-off between different design criteria. Primarily, through the evaluation with actual taxi operation data offered by Seoul Metropolitan Government, we challenge the natural expectation that the RL-based approaches yield the best result by showing that a lightweight greedy algorithm can have a competitive advantage. Moreover, we break the norm of dissecting the service area into sub-zones and show that matching passengers beyond arbitrary boundaries generates significantly higher operating income and profit.},

This article considers joint charging scheduling, order dispatching, and vehicle rebalancing for large-scale shared EV fleet operator. To maximize the welfare of fleet operator, we model the joint decision making as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with binary linear programming (BLP) to develop a near-optimal solution. The neural network is used to evaluate the state value of EVs at different times, locations, and states of charge. Based on the state value, dynamic electricity prices and order information, the online scheduling is modeled as a BLP problem where the decision variables representing whether an EV will 1) take an order, 2) rebalance to a position, or 3) charge. We also propose a constrained rebalancing method to improve the exploration efficiency of training. Moreover, we provide a tabular method with proved convergence as a fallback option to demonstrate the near-optimal characteristics of the proposed approach.

	abstract = {One major challenge for on-demand mobility service (OMS) providers is to seamlessly match empty vehicles with trip requests so that the total vacant mileage is minimized. In this study, we develop an innovative data-driven approach for devising efficient vehicle relocation policy for OMS that (1) proactively relocates vehicles before the demand is observed and (2) reduces the inequality among drivers’ income so that the proactive relocation policy is fair and is likely to be followed by drivers. Our approach represents the fusion of optimization and machine learning methods, which comprises three steps: First, we formulate the optimal proactive relocation as an optimal/stable matching problems and solve for global optimal solutions based on historical data. Second, the optimal solutions are then grouped and fed to train the deep learning models which consist of fully connected layers and long short-term memory networks. Low rank approximation is introduced to reduce the model complexity and improve the training performances. Finally, we use the trained model to predict the relocation policy which can be implemented in real time. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the performances of the proposed method using New York City taxi data. The results suggest that our method will reduce empty mileage per trip by 54–70\% under the optimal matching strategy, and a 25–32\% reduction can also be achieved by following the stable matching strategy. We also validate that the predicted relocation policies are robust in the presence of uncertain passenger demand level and passenger trip-requesting behavior.},

In this paper, we consider the operation planning problem involving vehicle dispatching, relocation, and recharging decisions. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to generate the optimal policy that maximizes the total profits. We propose a flexible policy to provide optimal actions according to the reward considering future requests and vehicle availability. We show that our model outperforms the predetermined rules on improving profits. To handle the curse-of-dimensionality caused by the large scale of state space and uncertainty, we develop an asynchronous learning method to solve the problem by approximating the value function. We first draw the samples of exogenous information and update the quality of approximations based on the quality of decisions, then approximate the exact cost-to-go value function by solving an approximation subproblem efficiently given the state at each period. Two variant algorithms are presented for cases with scarce and sufficient information. We also incorporate the state aggregation and post-decision analysis to further improve computational efficiency. We use a set of shared actual data from Didi platform to verify the proposed model in numerical experiments.

	abstract = {Mobility on demand (MoD) systems show great promise in realizing flexible and efficient urban transportation. However, significant technical challenges arise from operational decision making associated with MoD vehicle dispatch and fleet rebalancing. For this reason, operators tend to employ simplified algorithms that have been demonstrated to work well in a particular setting. To help bridge the gap between novel and existing methods, we propose a modular framework for fleet rebalancing based on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) that can leverage an existing dispatch method to minimize system cost. In particular, by treating dispatch as part of the environment dynamics, a centralized agent can learn to intermittently direct the dispatcher to reposition free vehicles and mitigate against fleet imbalance. We formulate RL state and action spaces as distributions over a grid partitioning of the operating area, making the framework scalable and avoiding the complexities associated with multiagent RL. Numerical experiments, using real-world trip and network data, demonstrate that RL reduces waiting time by 28\% to 38\% for the same-day evaluation, 17\% to 44\% for cross-day evaluation, and 22\% to 25\% for cross-season evaluation compared with no rebalancing scenarios. This approach has several distinct advantages over baseline methods including: improved system cost; high degree of adaptability to the selected dispatch method; and the ability to perform scale-invariant transfer learning between problem instances with similar vehicle and request distributions.},

Here we address this issue in the context of a dynamic and stochastic patient transportation problem, where besides considering new events, we also incorporate stochastic information about future events. We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality benefits from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We find that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.},

	abstract = {As transportation network companies and automobile manufacturers continue to invest in the development of self-driving vehicles, it can be expected that autonomous taxi (a-taxi) fleets will become a major component of on-demand transport services in the foreseeable future. The majority of existing automated fleet management systems focus on central dispatch strategies that rely on real-time information and communication. This paper proposes a novel decentralised cooperative cruising method for offline operation of a-taxi fleets, which serves as a contingency plan during a full communication shutdown. The proposed method acts as an emergency plan for the system to continue serving passengers with the objective of maximising the total number of served passengers by the fleet. The method uses historical trip data to estimate PageRank centralities of roads as a proxy of long-term likelihood of finding waiting passengers over a series of trips. The proposed method uses this metric to (i) compute weighted shortest paths for vacant a-taxi cruising route planning, and (ii) partition the network into homogeneous regions for effective cruising destination choice (mission planning). The movements of vacant a-taxis between regions are modelled as a Markov chain such that a transition probability matrix is computed to achieve the optimal spatial distribution of vacant a-taxis to maximise the total expected pick-ups by the fleet, estimated based on bilateral meeting functions. Compared to benchmark strategies which select destinations randomly and cruise along the shortest travel time path, the proposed method shows significant improvements in service performances for different fleet sizes.},

	abstract = {On-demand ride-pooling (e.g., UberPool, LyftLine, GrabShare) has recently become popular because of its ability to lower costs for passengers while simultaneously increasing revenue for drivers and aggregation companies (e.g., Uber). Unlike in Taxi on Demand (ToD) services – where a vehicle is assigned one passenger at a time – in on-demand ride-pooling, each vehicle must simultaneously serve multiple passengers with heterogeneous origin and destination pairs without violating any quality constraints. To ensure near real-time response, existing solutions to the real-time ride-pooling problem are myopic in that they optimise the objective (e.g., maximise the number of passengers served) for the current time step without considering the effect such an assignment could have on assignments in future time steps. However, considering the future effects of an assignment that also has to consider what combinations of passenger requests can be assigned to vehicles adds a layer of combinatorial complexity to the already challenging problem of considering future effects in the ToD case.A popular approach that addresses the limitations of myopic assignments in ToD problems is Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). Existing ADP methods for ToD can only handle Linear Program (LP) based assignments, however, as the value update relies on dual values from the LP. The assignment problem in ride pooling requires an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that has bad LP relaxations. Therefore, our key technical contribution is in providing a general ADP method that can learn from the ILP based assignment found in ride-pooling. Additionally, we handle the extra combinatorial complexity from combinations of passenger requests by using a Neural Network based approximate value function and show a connection to Deep Reinforcement Learning that allows us to learn this value-function with increased stability and sample-efficiency. We show that our approach easily outperforms leading approaches for on-demand ride-pooling on a real-world dataset by up to 16\%, a significant improvement in city-scale transportation problems.},

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method combined with an advanced policy gradient algorithm for this large-scale dynamic optimization problem. An agent-based simulation platform was developed to model the dynamic system of a fixed stop/station loop route, autonomous bus fleet, and passengers. This platform was also applied to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the developed algorithm outperforms other reinforcement learning methods in the multi-agent domain. The simulation results also reveal the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in outperforming the existing scheduled bus system in terms of the bus fleet size and passenger wait times for bus routes with comparatively lesser number of passengers.},

	abstract = {A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) network can be defined as a set of connected vehicles including CAVs that operate on a specific spatial scope that may be a road network, corridor, or segment. The spatial scope constitutes an environment where traffic information is shared and instructions are issued for controlling the CAVs movements. Within such a spatial scope, high-level cooperation among CAVs fostered by joint planning and control of their movements can greatly enhance the safety and mobility performance of their operations. Unfortunately, the highly combinatory and volatile nature of CAV networks due to the dynamic number of agents (vehicles) and the fast-growing joint action space associated with multi-agent driving tasks pose difficultly in achieving cooperative control. The problem is NP-hard and cannot be efficiently resolved using rule-based control techniques. Also, there is a great deal of information in the literature regarding sensing technologies and control logic in CAV operations but relatively little information on the integration of information from collaborative sensing and connectivity sources. Therefore, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that combines graphic convolution neural network with deep Q-network to form an innovative graphic convolution Q network that serves as the information fusion module and decision processor. In this study, the spatial scope we consider for the CAV network is a multi-lane road corridor. We demonstrate the proposed control algorithm using the application context of freeway lane-changing at the approaches to an exit ramp. For purposes of comparison, the proposed model is evaluated vis-à-vis traditional rule-based and long short-term memory-based fusion models. The results suggest that the proposed model is capable of aggregating information received from sensing and connectivity sources and prescribing efficient operative lane-change decisions for multiple CAVs, in a manner that enhances safety and mobility. That way, the operational intentions of individual CAVs can be fulfilled even in partially observed and highly dynamic mixed traffic streams. The paper presents experimental evidence to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance CAV operations. The proposed algorithm can be deployed at roadside units or cloud platforms or other centralized control facilities.},

	abstract = {Mobility systems featuring shared vehicles are often unable to serve all potential customers, as the distribution of demand does not coincide with the positions of vehicles at any given time. System operators often choose to reposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively during the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex dynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be made, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight computation time constraints inherent to real-time decision-making. We first present a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that its linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing literature. We then adapt a two-stage stochastic approximation scheme from the generic SPAR algorithm due to Powell et al., in which rebalancing plans are optimized against a value function representing the expected cost (in terms of fulfilled and unfulfilled customer demand) of the future evolution of the system. The true value function is approximated by a separable function of contributions due to the rebalancing actions carried out at each station and each time step of the planning horizon. The new algorithm requires surprisingly few iterations to yield high-quality solutions, and is suited to real-time use as it can be terminated early if required. We provide insight into this good performance by examining the mathematical properties of our new flow formulation, and perform rigorous tests on standardized benchmark networks to explore the effect of system size. We then use data from Philadelphia’s public bike sharing scheme to demonstrate that the approach also yields performance gains for real systems.},

A spatial-and-temporal decomposition heuristic is applied and each subproblem is solved using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), for which we show properties of the approximated value function at each stage. Our model is benchmarked with the one that optimizes vehicle dispatch without ride-pooling and the one that matches current drivers and passengers without demand forecasting. Using test instances generated based on the New York City taxi data during one peak hour, we conduct computational studies and sensitivity analysis to show (i) empirical convergence of ADP, (ii) benefit of ride-pooling, and (iii) value of future supply-demand information.},

It is found that using friends in a social network to assist in last mile delivery greatly reduces delivery costs and total emissions while ensuring speedy and reliable delivery. The proposed new delivery method also mitigates the privacy concerns and not-at-home syndrome that widely exist in last mile delivery.},

	abstract = {One innovative solution to the last-mile delivery problem is the self-service locker system. Motivated by a real case in Singapore, we consider a POP-Locker Alliance who operates a set of POP-stations and wishes to improve the last-mile delivery by opening new locker facilities. We propose a quantitative approach to determine the optimal locker location with the objective to maximize the overall service provided by the alliance. Customer’s choices regarding the use of facilities are explicitly considered. They are predicted by a multinomial logit model. We then formulate the location problem as a multi-ratio linear-fractional 0–1 program and provide two solution approaches. The first one is to reformulate the original problem as a mixed-integer linear program, which is further strengthened using conditional McCormick inequalities. This approach is an exact method, developed for small-scale problems. For large-scale problems, we propose an alternating algorithm, i.e., Quadratic Transform with Linear Alternating (QT-LA). The numerical experiment indicates that QT-LA is an efficient approach that yields high-quality solutions. Finally, we conducted a case study. The results highlighted the importance of considering the customers’ choices. Under different parameter values of the multinomial logit model, the deci­ sions could be completely different. Therefore, the parameter value should be carefully estimated in advance.},

Automatic delivery stations represent a solution to reduce mislaid deliveries and consolidate parcels drop-off, minimizing the kilometers travelled, and the costs of urban goods distribution. In order to better understand online shoppers' attitudes towards new delivery services, we analyze the potential demand of automatic delivery stations (lockers) in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. For this purpose, we develop a survey according to stated preference and revealed preference methods, and we assess potential users considering two deliveries services: home delivery and automated delivery stations. The results indicate that, although home delivery is the preferred option, automatic delivery stations score high potential demand for online shoppers. This paper provides an approach to integrate the impact of ﬁnal consumers' preferences on shaping last-mile operations, and it thus helps policymakers to identify the most suitable innovations to speciﬁc urban settings.},

	abstract = {E-grocers with an attended home delivery service model operate in a highly competitive market characterized by thin profit margins. To ensure a profit-maximizing delivery schedule, the requirements for the joint management of demand and the vehicle routes are substantial. Therefore, we study an e-grocer’s operational problem of managing demand by means of dynamic time slot allocation. The purpose of dynamically allocating time slots is to influence customers’ choices by offering a selection of time slots to a customer request, such that the overall expected profit of the resulting delivery schedule is maximized. The time slot offer decisions mainly depend on a request’s opportunity cost. Hence, we first propose a mixed-integer linear program to approximate this opportunity cost, which scales linearly with the number of decision variables. In this approximation, we consider the consequences of expected time slot offer decisions for future customers on the final delivery schedule. We explicitly incorporate customer choice behavior using a generalized attraction model. Second, we propose a nonlinear binary program and its linearization based on the underlying choice model to make time slot offer decisions using the approximated opportunity cost. Due to the formulation’s structural properties, it can be efficiently solved. In a computational study, we show the superiority of our approach in comparison to benchmarks applied in the academic literature and its applicability in an online environment.},

Low Emission Zones (LEZ) are delimited areas of a city or metropolitan area from which the vehicles that pollute the most are banned. Targeted vehicles are often freight vehicles as a result of the high levels of pollution emitted by today’s urban delivery fleets. Through literature review, interviews and two specific surveys in London and Berlin, we analyzed LEZ impacts on the urban freight industry. We showed that the creation of a LEZ reduces the number of firms making urban deliveries, and that this reduction has probably benefited the urban freight market by compelling both public and private stakeholders to finds ways to promote more efficient activities. Such modernization is necessary as the urban freight market is dysfunctional in many respects: environmentally because of the old vehicles used until now, and socially because of the large number of small firms which find it difficult to maintain a sufficient level of business activity without breaking the sector’s labor laws and safety standards.},

	abstract = {In France, e-commerce has experienced steady growth over the past decade. A striking aspect is that it is now widespread among different segments of the population, including suburban and rural households. This growth has generated signiﬁcant demand for dedicated delivery services to end consumers. Pickup points (PP) represent a fast-growing alternative to home delivery, accounting for about 20\% of parcel deliveries to households. The article focuses on the strategy of PP network operators. Our results are threefold. We have documented the recent development of alternative parcel delivery services to e-shoppers in Europe, and especially in France. We have described how the operators have decided to organize their PP network, identifying main variables and constraints. We have provided an analysis of the spatial distribution of PPs in France. The paper shows that at the French national level, PPs are now a well established alternative to home deliveries and their presence covers urban, suburban and rural areas. While PP density in remote areas decreases faster than population density, rural e-consumers' accessibility to PP sites has reached a viable level. Furthermore, PP delivery services generate new types of B2B freight trips that are not yet included in current urban freight models.},

Accordingly, some commuters might be forced to take on longer commutes due to rising rents in central locations. In this study, we investigate empirically whether the rental differential between employment centres and residential areas predicts changes in average commuting times. To this end, we consider a gravity model of commuting flows for Ireland over 2011–2016. We present results for Ireland and the metropolitan area of Dublin, which constitutes the largest commuting region in Ireland. The results imply that a 10\% rise in rents in employment centres is associated with an up to 0.6 minute rise in one-way daily average commuting times nationally (about 2.2\% of the average commute duration).},

However, using these methods, only the frequent activities in each cluster are extracted and qualitatively described; the infrequent activities and their related travel episodes are disregarded. Thus, to quantify the occurrence probabilities of all the daily activities as well as their sequential orders, we develop a novel process to build multiple alignments of the sequences and subsequently derive proﬁle Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs). This process consists of 4 major steps. First, activity sequences are clustered based on a pre-deﬁned scheme. The frequent activities along with their sequential orders are then identiﬁed in each cluster, and they are subsequently used as a template to guide the construction of a multiple alignment of the cluster of sequences. Finally, a pHMM is employed to convert the multiple alignment into a position-speciﬁc scoring system, representing the probability of each frequent activity at each important position of the alignment as well as the probabilities of both insertion and deletion of infrequent activities.},

The adaptation of freight models to the urban environment strongly relies on an eﬃcient unit of observation, which is introduced as the spine of the model after discussing the main approaches of urban freight transport modelling. The main features of the model are then presented from the generation to the distribution of freight operations and are confronted to elements of validation. The robustness of the model is also discussed through time by analysing elements of its initial calibration 20 years ago and the latest results of urban freight surveys in order to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. We show that the model is able to summarize eﬃciently the urban freight transport phenomenon and is still statistically robust twenty years after its ﬁrst design although it needs marginal adaptations on organisational elements.},

The transfer of a previously estimated model to a new application context can reduce or eliminate the need for a large data collection and model development effort in the application context. Therefore, the main goal of the research is to compare the freight transport demand in two European cities (Rome and Santander) in order to highlight which similarities and differences depend on some factors and demonstrates that there are many different patterns of urban distribution that need to be taken into account. The analysis is based on some similar surveys carried out in the cities that are also very different in terms of spatial and economic patterns. Furthermore, the available surveys in Rome and Santander have been the basis for the calibration also in Santander of a modelling system for urban freight demand forecast set up in Rome.

	abstract = {End-consumer choices in relation to type of retail outlet impact upon shopping travel frequency and mode, and hence on freight distribution ﬂows for restocking shops. The characteristics of the restocking process, in terms of delivery size, delivery frequency, freight vehicle type and so on, are strictly related to the size of commercial activities to be restocked. Since end-consumer choices depend on end-consumer characteristics, such as age, gender and occupation, which change over time in an urban area, changes in such characteristics impact upon the nature of freight restocking. In city logistics analysis, in order to forecast the future characteristics of freight distribution in an urban area, a system of models is required that allows shopping mobility and freight restocking distribution to be considered in an integrated approach, with shopping demand models that take end-consumer characteristics into account. This paper discusses a number of issues related to the transportation impacts of shopping attitudes on urban freight distribution. It focuses on the factors that mainly inﬂuence freight distribution: quantity and choices of retail type (including e-shopping). After an analysis of state-of-the-art shopping mobility demand modelling, a new system of models for simulating shopping choices is presented. The models were obtained by using surveys carried out in Rome where more than 300 families were interviewed. Jointly with urban restocking models, they were used to assess the effects on freight restocking under a future scenario when demographic changes occur in a medium-size urban area. The results indicate that effects of demographic changes on shop restocking ﬂows can be signiﬁcant. For example, the shifting of middle aged adults into later age could result in an increase in shopping trips to nearby shops, mainly to small and medium-size retail outlets. This could lead to a consequent increase in car-kms. Further, expectation of an increase in e-shopping could reduce consumer trips. However, new measures able to promote consolidation for making home deliveries more efﬁcient should be investigated.},

	abstract = {Microsimulation of urban systems evolution requires synthetic population as a key input. Currently, the focus is on treating synthesis as a ﬁtting problem and thus various techniques have been developed, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Combinatorial Optimization based techniques. The key shortcomings of these procedures include: (a) ﬁtting of one contingency table, while there may be other solutions matching the available data (b) due to cloning rather than true synthesis of the population, losing the heterogeneity that may not have been captured in the microdata (c) over reliance on the accuracy of the data to determine the cloning weights (d) poor scalability with respect to the increase in number of attributes of the synthesized agents. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation based approach. Partial views of the joint distribution of agent’s attributes that are available from various data sources can be used to simulate draws from the original distribution. The real population from Swiss census is used to compare the performance of simulation based synthesis with the standard IPF. The standard root mean square error statistics indicated that even the worst case simulation based synthesis (SRMSE = 0.35) outperformed the best case IPF synthesis (SRMSE = 0.64). We also used this methodology to generate the synthetic population for Brussels, Belgium where the data availability was highly limited.},

We use structural restrictions and a model averaging method to learn the network structure of the Bayesian network in order to predict the heuristics of individuals’ location selection. The empirical study shows the proposed method can effectively obtain Bayesian networks with a consistent dependency structure.

	abstract = {The energy used to move freight comprised about 17\% of all the energy consumed in the United States in 2010. This percentage was an increase from 8.7\% in 1970 even though fuel efﬁciency gradually improved over the period. One major reason of this phenomenon is that the longer supply chains of many industries caused by globalization increase freight movement. Various carbon policies have been discussed and even implemented for some industry sectors in the European Union to reduce carbon emissions. However, the emissions of surface transportation have not been well studied. This paper investigates three of the most common carbon policies: carbon emission tax, inﬂexible cap, and cap-and-trade. The impact on a company may include the redesign of its supply chains and different choices of transportation modes (truck, rail, or waterway). This paper proposes optimization models for major retailers, who make a huge contribution to freight movement, to design their supply chains under various carbon policies. The results from the models can help policy makers to predict the impact of policies on overall emissions in the freight transportation sector. The model may also be incorporated into the integrated assessment models for climate change analyses. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the impact of the policy parameters on carbon emissions and logistics cost. This research uses the supply chain of a major U.S. retailer (i.e., Wal-Mart) to demonstrate how to use the models and conduct the sensitivity analysis. In order to realize signiﬁcant emission reduction, a redesign of supply chains of major retailers is necessary and will be triggered only by a high carbon tax rate, a high carbon price, or a very strict carbon cap, which all may involve high social and/or economic complexity. Numerical experiments show that different policies have different impacts on the costs and the effectiveness of emission reduction. How to choose policy parameters is critical to the effectiveness of a carbon policy. The different sensitivity also implies different challenges during the implementation of the policies, such as the high cost preventing retailers from accepting any carbon taxes and the difﬁculty of reaching an agreement on the carbon caps between retailers and policy makers.},

The problem considers different carbon emission control policies with heterogeneous transportation fleets and allows for lost sales. The aim is to select the optimal carbon control policy with optimal production, inventory, and delivery quantities. The proposed model is formulated as both a deterministic and a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem. The proposed formulations are demonstrated through two case studies, a simulated reverse logistics supply chain and an actual home appliances production supply chain with remanufacturing options. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to test for the effect of different parameters on the optimal solution. Results indicate that the carbon policy selected has significant effect on the supply chain performance with carbon price being the most significant parameter.},

City logistics represents a strategy of eﬃcient freight transportation and material handling to fulﬁll customer and business demands. Within the frame of this paper, the authors describe an optimization model of a multi-echelon collection and distribution system, focusing on downtown areas and energy eﬃciency, sustainability, and emission reduction. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model of collection and distribution problems, including package delivery, municipal waste collection, home delivery services, and supply of supermarkets and oﬃces. The object of the optimization model is twofold: ﬁrstly, to design the optimal structure of the multi-echelon collection and distribution system, including layout planning and the determination of required transportation resources, like e-cars, e-bikes, and the use of public transportation; and secondly, to optimize the operation strategy of the multi-echelon supply chain, including resource allocation and scheduling problems. Next, a heuristic approach is described, whose performance is validated with common benchmark functions, such as metaheuristic evaluation. The scenario analysis demonstrates the application of the described model and shows the optimal layout, resource allocation, and operation strategy focusing on energy eﬃciency.},

	abstract = {City logistics is a discipline specialized to cope with the sustainability problems encountered in urban freight transport. A key characteristic of it is the heterogeneity of the stakeholders involved. Besides the traditional logistics actors such as shippers, carriers and receivers that share consistent interests (i.e. price and quality), city logistics highly respect the interests of public administrators and citizens that care more about the social welfare. To reach an optimal balance between private and public beneﬁt, it is necessary to understand and in turn forecast the behavior pattern of different groups. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been practiced as an unconventional tool to fulﬁll this task for its strong capability on capturing the dynamic behavior of individual stakeholders and their interconnections. Referring to other domains (e.g. energy system) where the application of agent-based modeling is relatively mature, a following urgency is to achieve interoperability and in turn reusability between models via introducing formal ontology as a shared template with which developers can standardize their models. This paper introduces an initiative of developing an ontology that formalizes the domain knowledge of city logistics.},

The authors developed models for NYCZR and function and activity of LBCS and used the ITE manual's trip rates. Root mean square error analysis was used to compare the performance of these models. It was found that models for NYCZR and LBCS land use classification codes provide better alternatives to ITE trip rates because they give more accurate estimates of freight trip attraction, cover a wider range of land use classifications, and are exclusively for freight trip attraction.},

	abstract = {Increasing urbanization, and the environmental and liveability impacts associated with urban activity, have directed attention to the need for sustainable cities. Achieving sustainable urban development requires including freight systems in strategic urban development plans. In this context, joint efforts involving academia and public- and private sector to collect the right data and develop suitable models, can contribute toward a better understanding of establishments’ freight needs, the quantiﬁcation of freight’s trafﬁc impacts and the development of appropriate methods to support decision making and strategic plans. This paper studies urban commercial establishments’ freight needs and impacts on trafﬁc using data collected from establishments in the City of Gothenburg (Sweden). The data cover different zones of the city and include commercial sectors found typically in urban cores (e.g., retailers, food services, health care, public sector ofﬁces and education). The paper introduces a set of statistical models—developed based on regression analyses and discrete choice models—to estimate the number of freight trips produced and attracted per week, and the attraction of weight and volumes of freight. In addition to shed light on the factors determining establishments’ freight- and freight trips generation, the models are designed with the purpose of assisting planning and policy design efforts, thus the explanatory variables are selected based on suitability and availability. The results show that retailers of perishable goods have the highest freight trip generation per establishment, followed by public sector ofﬁces and education establishments, retailers of nonperishable goods and restaurants. The results also reveal a heterogeneity between sectors, and a differential business size effect across commercial sectors.},

This paper presents a freight generation model for the Belgian territory. Based on data gathered on transport flows by commodity type and loading unit and data on population density and business establishments with their characteristics, generated and attracted freight volumes were obtained for 4934 zones subdividing the country. A generalized linear regression analysis with log link was used to do so. Both generated and attracted volumes are connected to one another by a conditional probability function, resulting in an origin-destination matrix. The analysis is to our knowledge unique as modelled volumes and flows can be distinguished by commodity types and loading unit, and this at very detailed geographical scale. This will lead to new in-depth analyses and added value, including effects of loading unit dependent logistics cost structures..},

Diesel engines are the main power source of trucks and their emission eﬃciency is the key challenge in environmentally sound freight transportation. This review paper addresses the academic literature focusing on truck emissions. The paper relies on the preliminary hypothesis that simple single solutions are nonexistent and that there will be a collection of suggestions and solutions for improving the emission eﬃciency in trucks. The paper focuses on the technical properties, emission types, and fuel solutions used in freight logistics.

	abstract = {In recent years, the reduction of freight vehicle trips during peak hours has been a common policy goal. To this end, policies have been implemented to shift logistics operations to nighttime hours. The purpose of such policies has generally been to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. However, the atmospheric boundary layer is generally more stable during the night than the day. Consequently, shifting logistics operations to the night may increase 24-h average concentrations of diesel exhaust pollutants in many locations. This paper presents realistic scenarios for two California cities, which provide diesel exhaust concentration and human intake estimates after temporal redistributions of daily logistics operations. Estimates are made for multiple redistribution patterns, including from 07:00–19:00 to 19:00–07:00, similar to daytime congestion charging polices, and from 03:00–18:00 to 18:00–03:00, corresponding to the PierPASS program at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Results for these two redistribution scenarios indicate that 24-h average exhaust concentrations would increase at most locations in California, and daily human intake is likely to worsen or be unimproved at best. These results are shown to be worse for inland than coastal settings, due to differences in meteorology. Trafﬁc congestion effects are considered, using a new graphical method, which depicts how off-peak policies can be environmentally improving or damaging, depending on trafﬁc speeds and meteorology.},

To cast light on this topic, we established a framework combining an optimization model with economic analysis to determine the optimal behavior of an individual delivery service provider company and social impacts (e.g., externalities and welfare) in response to policies designed to support EVs, such as purchase subsidy, limited access (zone fee) to congestion/low-emission zones with exemptions for EVs, and vehicle taxes with exemptions for EVs. Numerical experiments showed that the zone fee can increase the company’s total logistics costs but improve the social welfare. It greatly reduced the external cost inside the congestion/low-emission zone with a high population, dense pollution, and heavy traﬃc. The vehicle taxes and subsidy were found to have the same inﬂuence on the company and society, although they have diﬀerent eﬀects with low tax/subsidy rates because their diﬀerent eﬀects on vehicle routing plans. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis. Local factors at the company and city levels (e.g., types of vehicle and transport network) are also important to designing eﬃcient policies for urban logistics that support EVs.},

	abstract = {The advent of microsimulation approaches in travel demand modeling, wherein activity-travel patterns of individual travelers are simulated in time and space, has motivated the development of synthetic population generators. These generators typically use census-based marginal distributions on household attributes to generate joint distributions on variables of interest using standard iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedures. Households are then randomly drawn from an available sample in accordance with the joint distribution such that household-level attributes are matched perfectly. However, these traditional procedures do not control for person-level attributes and joint distributions of personal characteristics. In this paper, a heuristic approach, called the Iterative Proportional Updating (IPU) algorithm, is presented to generate synthetic populations whereby both household-level and person-level characteristics of interest can be matched in a computationally efficient manner. The algorithm involves iteratively adjusting and reallocating weights among households of a certain type (cell in the joint distribution) until both household and person-level attributes are matched. The algorithm is illustrated with a small example, and then demonstrated in the context of a real-world application using small geographies (blockgroups) in the Maricopa County of Arizona in the United States. The algorithm is found to perform very well, both from the standpoint of matching household and person-level distributions and computation time. It appears that the proposed algorithm holds promise to serve as a practical population synthesis procedure in the context of activitybased microsimulation modeling.},

To meet this goal, this study proposes employing a welfare-based (i.e. logsum-based) measure of accessibility, obtained via estimating a hierarchical work destination-commute mode choice model. The employment accessibility logsum measure incorporates the spatial distribution of worker residences and employment opportunities, the attributes of the available commute modes, and the characteristics of individual workers. The study further captures heterogeneity of workers using a latent class analysis (LCA) approach to account for different worker clusters valuing different types of employment opportunities differently, in which the socio-demographic characteristics of workers are the LCA model inputs. The accessibility analysis results in Southern California indicate: (i) the accessibility benefit differences across latent classes are modest but young workers and lowincome workers do see higher benefits than high- and middle-income workers; (ii) there are substantial spatial differences in accessibility benefits with workers living in lower density areas benefiting more than workers living in high-density areas; (iii) nearly all the accessibility benefits come from the SAMS-only mode as opposed to the SAMS+Transit mode; and (iv) the SAMS cost per mile assumption significantly impacts the magnitude of the overall employment accessibility benefits.},

Results suggest the average SAV in this region can serve at most 30 person-trips per day with less than 5 min average wait time, but generates 13\% more vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). With dynamic ride-sharing (DRS), SAV VMT fell, on average, by 17\% and empty VMT (eVMT) fell by 26\%. Compared to idling-at-curb scenarios, parkingrestricted scenarios generated 8\% more VMT. Relying on 52 mi/gallon hybrid electric SAVs, as opposed to a 31 mi/gallon conventional drivetrain SAV, is estimated to lower travelers’ energy use by 21\% and reduce tailpipe emissions by 30\%, assuming no new or longer trips. Similarly, a 106 mi/gallon equivalent battery-electric fleet does much better by lowering energy use by 64\%.},

	abstract = {High costs of owning fully-automated or autonomous vehicles (AVs) will fuel the demand for shared mobility, with zero driver costs. Although sharing sounds good for the transport system, congestion can easily rise without adequate policy measures. Many or all public transit lines will continue to exist, and carefully-designed policies can be implemented to make good use of fixed public assets, like commuter- and light-rail lines. In this study, a shared AV (SAV) fleet is analyzed as a potential solution to the first-mile-last-mile (FMLM) problem for access to and from public transit. Essentially, SAVs are analyzed as collectordistributor systems for these mass-movers and compared with a door-to-door (D2D) service. Results from an agent-based simulation of Austin, Texas, show that SAVs have the potential to help solve FMLM transit problems when fare benefits are provided to transit users. Restricting SAV use for FMLM trips increases transit coverage, lowers average access and egress walking distance, and shifts demand away from park-and-ride and long walk trips. When SAVs are available for both D2D use and FMLM trips, high SAV fares help maintain transit demand, without which the transit demand may decrease significantly, affecting the transit supply and the overall system reliability. Policy makers and planners should be wary of this shift away from transit and may be able to increase transit usage using policies tested in this study.},

	abstract = {The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) is a virtual certainty. Much less certain is the timing of their introduction and how rapid the transition to full automation will be. Various governments are already working to facilitate this shift by, for example, amending and elaborating regulations to support the introduction of AVs, or supporting tests in different urban environments. Meanwhile, urban and regional planners and decisionmakers are still grappling with the uncertainties and differing opinions about the possible impacts of AVs on land-use changes and location choices, particularly in relation to the space available for vehicles, both moving (i.e. roadspace) and stationary (i.e. parking space). This paper uses a backcasting approach to identify critical policy decisions and measures to be taken before the implementation of AVs, so as to achieve a more desirable, attractive and high-quality city. These policy measures primarily relate to the reuse and reallocation of parking and roadspace. Two strategic decisions are found to be essential to meet the major goals of sustainable and liveable cities: a clear commitment to a shared mobility and the delimitation of Core Attractive Mixed-use Spaces (CAMS). In order to deliver these desired urbanisation patterns, a set of three policy paths, involving eight policy packages, is proposed for the next 20–30 years. This article provides urban and regional decision-makers with examples of interventions that can be implemented beyond and during the implementation of AVs.},

	abstract = {The coming of automated vehicles (AVs) and Mobility-on-Demand (MoD services) is expected to reduce urban parking demand and correspondingly alter the urban parking landscape in a significant way. Multiple modeling efforts have already demonstrated that Shared AVs (SAVs) have promising potential to decrease urban parking demand. However, previous studies have only examined SAV parking demand at one point in time, with various market penetrations. It remains unclear what the demand reduction trajectory will be like during the transition period when there is a mix of SAVs, Privately-Owned AVs (PAVs), Shared Conventional Vehicles (SCVs), and Conventional Private Vehicles (CPVs). This study fills this gap by developing an agent-based simulation model to examine the spatially and temporally explicit parking reduction trends with mixed travel modes from 2020–2040. The results indicate that in the most optimal AV and MoD adoption scenario, the parking demand will decrease by over 20\% after 2030, especially in core urban areas. Meanwhile, the parking demand in residential zones may double, which could lead to transportation equity concerns. Additionally, parking relocation may also induce environmental issues by generating a considerable amount of empty Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). To reap the benefits brought by AVs and MoD systems and to mitigate the accompanying social and environmental issues, our results suggest that proactive policymakers in the next decade will need to modify land use regulations for both new developments and existing parking infrastructure in commercial and residential zones, as well as update travel demand management policies.},

	abstract = {Automated Vehicles (AVs) oﬀer their users a possibility to perform new non-driving activities while being on the way. The eﬀects of this opportunity on travel choices and travel demand have mostly been conceptualised and modelled via a reduced penalty associated with (in-vehicle) travel time. This approach invariably leads to a prediction of more car-travel. However, we argue that reductions in the size of the travel time penalty are only a crude proxy for the variety of changes in time-use and travel patterns that are likely to occur at the advent of AVs. For example, performing activities in an AV can save time and in this way enable the execution of other activities within a day. Activities in an AV may also eliminate or generate a need for some other activities and travel. This may lead to an increase, or decrease in travel time, depending on the traveller’s preferences, schedule, and local accessibility. Neglecting these dynamics is likely to bias forecasts of travel demand and travel behaviour in the AV-era. In this paper, we present an optimisation model which rigorously captures the time-use eﬀects of travellers’ ability to perform on-board activities. Using a series of worked out examples, we test the face validity of the model and demonstrate how it can be used to predict travel choices in the AV-era.},

Here we study the effects of the underlying street network topology on the viability of ride bundling analytically and in simulations. Using numerical and analytical approaches we find that system performance can be measured in the number of scheduled stops per vehicle. Its scaling with the request rate is approximately linear and the slope, that depends on the network topology, is a measure of the ease of ridesharing in that topology. This dependence is caused by the different growth of the route volume, which we compute analytically for the simplest networks served by a single vehicle.},

A key to success in this novel approach is balancing individual preferences of travelers with system constraints. The model incorporates two types of constraints: 1) capacity constraints of the transport infrastructure. 2) natural time and space constraints during the execution of individual 24-hour day plans.

We study the effectiveness of online solution algorithms for this proposed strategy. Queueing-theoretic vehicle dispatch and idle vehicle relocation algorithms are customized for the problem. Several experiments are conducted first with a synthetic instance to design and test the effectiveness of this integrated solution method, the influence of different model parameters, and measure the benefit of such cooperation. Results suggest that rideshare vehicle travel time can drop by 40–60\% consistently while passenger journey times can be reduced by 50–60\% when demand is high. A case study of Long Island commuters to New York City (NYC) suggests having the proposed operating strategy can substantially cut user journey times and operating costs by up to 54\% and 60\% each for a range of 10–30 taxis initiated per zone. This result shows that there are settings where such service is highly warranted.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to explore the relation between personal characteristics of pedestrians and their crossing behaviour in front of an automated vehicle (AV). For this purpose, a simulation experiment was developed using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) techniques. Sixty participants were asked to cross the road in a virtual environment displayed on a computer screen, allowing to record their crossing behaviour when in the presence of AVs and conventional vehicles (CVs). In some experimental conﬁgurations, the AVs communicated their intention to continue or not to continue their trajectories through the use of lights. The ABM allowed controlling the behaviour of the vehicles when interacting with the simulated avatar of the respondents. The subjects of the experiment were also asked to ﬁll in a questionnaire about usual behaviour in trafﬁc, as well as attitudes and risk perceptions toward crossing roads. The questionnaire data were used to estimate individual speciﬁc behavioural latent variables by means of principal component analysis which resulted in three main factors named: violations, lapses, and trust in AVs. The results of generalized linear mixed models applied to the data showed that besides the distance from the approaching vehicle and existence of a zebra crossing, pedestrians’ crossing decisions are signiﬁcantly affected by the participants’ age, familiarity with AVs, the communication between the AV and the pedestrian, and whether the approaching vehicle is an AV. Moreover, the introduction of the latent factors as explanatory variables into the regression models indicated that individual speciﬁc characteristics like willingness to take risks and violate trafﬁc rules, and trust in AVs can have additional explanatory power in the crossing decisions.},

The introduc­ tion and adoption of automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to have an impact on the development of cities as well, as the use of AVs may, for example, lead to more efficient road use and less need for parking spaces. In order to study those impacts, we developed a geospatially disaggregated system dynamics (SD) model, through the use of subscripts, of the Copenhagen metropolitan region. We used this SD model to explore the consequences of 12 main uncertainties related to the introduction of AVs on urban development and develop future scenarios following the exploratory modelling and analysis methodology. Our analysis led to two distinct scenarios. In one scenario, AVs lead to more vehicle use, which leads to more urban sprawl and more congestion as a consequence. In the other scenario, more shared use of cars leads to less traffic and more open space in the city.},

	abstract = {The growing demand for urban mobility highlights the need for relevant and sustainable solu­ tions in cities worldwide. Thus, we develop and implement a framework to analyze the systemic impacts of future urban mobility trends and policies. We build on prior work in classifying the world’s cities into 12 urban typologies that represent distinct land-use and behavioral char­ acteristics by introducing a generalized approach for creating a detailed, simulatable prototype city that is representative of a given typology. We then generate and simulate two auto-depen­ dent (largely US-specific) prototype cities via a state-of-the-art agent-based platform, SimMobility, for integrated demand microsimulation and supply mesoscopic simulation. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing the impacts of automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) implementation strategies in the cities based on demand, congestion, energy consumption and emissions outcomes. Our results show that the introduction of AMoD cannibalizes mass transit while increasing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and congestion. In sprawling auto-dependent cities with low transit penetration, the congestion and energy consumption effects under bestcase assumptions are similar regardless of whether AMoD competes with or complements mass transit. In dense auto-dependent cities with moderate transit modeshare, the integration of AMoD with transit yields better outcomes in terms of VKT and congestion. Such cities cannot afford to disinvest in mass transit, as this would result in unsustainable outcomes. Overall, this framework can provide insights into how AMoD can be sustainably harnessed not only in low-density and high-density auto-dependent cities, but also in other typologies.},

	abstract = {Mobility on demand (MoD) systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for sustainable personal urban mobility in cities. In the context of multi-agent simulation technology, the state-of-the-art lacks a platform that captures the dynamics between decentralized driver decision-making and the centralized coordinated decision-making. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing a comprehensive framework that models various facets of MoD, namely heterogeneous MoD driver decision-making and coordinated fleet management within SimMobility, an agent- and activity-based demand model integrated with a dynamic multi-modal network assignment model. To facilitate such a study, we propose an event-based modeling framework. Behavioral models were estimated to characterize the decision-making of drivers using a GPS dataset from a major MoD fleet operator in Singapore. The proposed framework was designed to accommodate behaviors of multiple ondemand services such as traditional MoD, Lyft-like services, and automated MoD (AMoD) services which interact with traffic simulators and a multi-modal transportation network. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework through a large-scale case study in Singapore comparing the fully decentralized traditional MoD with the future AMoD services in a realistic simulation setting. We found that AMoD results in a more efficient service even with increased demand. Parking strategies and fleet sizes will also have an effect on user satisfaction and network performance.},

In this paper, we investigate a new vehicle sharing system using AVs, referred to as autonomous vehicle sharing and reservation (AVSR). In such a system, travelers can request AV trips ahead of time and the AVSR system operator will optimally arrange AV pickup and delivery schedules and AV trip chains based on these requests. A linear programming model is proposed to efﬁciently solve for optimal solutions for AV trip chains and required ﬂeet size through constructed AVSR networks. Case studies show that AVSR can signiﬁcantly increase vehicle use rate (VUR) and consequentially reduce vehicle ownership signiﬁcantly. In the meantime, it is found that the actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in AVSR systems is not signiﬁcantly more than that of conventional taxis, despite inevitable empty hauls for vehicle relocation in AVSR systems. The results imply huge potential beneﬁts from AVSR systems on improving mobility and sustainability of our current transportation systems.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method of assigning trips to automated taxis (ATs) and designing the routes of those vehicles in an urban road network, and also considering the traffic congestion caused by this dynamic responsive service. The system is envisioned to provide a seamless door-to-door service within a city area for all passenger origins and destinations. An integer programming model is proposed to define the routing of the vehicles according to a profit maximization function, depending on the dynamic travel times, which varies with the ATs’ flow. This will be especially important when the number of automated vehicles (AVs) circulating on the roads is high enough that their routing will cause delays. This system should be able to serve not only the reserved travel requests, but also some real-time requests. A rolling horizon scheme is used to divide one day into several periods in which both the real-time and the booked demand will be considered together. The model was applied to the real size case study city of Delft, the Netherlands. The results allow assessing of the impact of the ATs movements on traffic congestion and the profitability of the system. From this case-study, it is possible to conclude that taking into account the effect of the vehicle flows on travel time leads to changes in the system profit, the satisfied percentage and the driving distance of the vehicles, which highlights the importance of this type of model in the assessment of the operational effects of ATs in the future.},

The simulation tool allows simulating the operation of the ADRTS in a complete graph and is applied to the case study of Arnhem, the Netherlands. For this case study it has been shown that for a minimum ﬂeet size following the imposed constraints, the operational costs range between 0.84 and 1.22 Euros and the average passenger wait time ranges between 2 and 6 min, according to the assumptions made on demand and operational parameters. The operational costs of the ADRTS showed to be in the same range of the current bus system, while providing a demand-responsive transport service with an average waiting time of around 4 min per passenger-trip. The economies of scale, which play an important role in public transport, are also apparent in the simulated ADRTS operations.},

To correct this problem, a new dynamic dial-a-ride policy is introduced, one that features non-myopic pricing based on optimal tolling of queues to ﬁt with the multi-server queueing approximation method proposed by Hyttiä et al. (2012) for large-scale systems. By including social optimal pricing, the social welfare of the resulting system outperforms the marginal pricing assumed for previous approaches over a range of test instances. In the examples tested, improvements in social welfare of the non-myopic pricing over the myopic pricing were in the 20–31\% range. For a given demand function, we can derive the optimal ﬂeet size to maximize social welfare. Sensitivity tests to the optimal price conﬁrm that it leads to an optimal social welfare while the marginal pricing policy does not. A comparison of single passenger taxis to shared-taxis shows that system cost may reduce at the expense of decreased social welfare, which agrees with the results of Jung et al. (2013).

	abstract = {In developing open data policies, governments aim to stimulate and guide the publication of government data and to gain advantages from its use. Currently there is a multiplicity of open data policies at various levels of government, whereas very little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact. Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available, as open data is a recent phenomenon and is thus in an early stage of development. In order to help bring about a better understanding of the common and differentiating elements in the policies and to identify the factors affecting the variation in policies, this paper develops a framework for comparing open data policies. The framework includes the factors of environment and context, policy content, performance indicators and public values. Using this framework, seven Dutch governmental policies at different government levels are compared. The comparison shows both similarities and differences among open data policies, providing opportunities to learn from each other's policies. The ﬁndings suggest that current policies are rather inward looking, open data policies can be improved by collaborating with other organizations, focusing on the impact of the policy, stimulating the use of open data and looking at the need to create a culture in which publicizing data is incorporated in daily working processes. The ﬁndings could contribute to the development of new open data policies and the improvement of existing open data policies.},

We argue that current open data platforms do not take into account the complexity of democratic processes which results in overly simplistic approaches to open data platform design. Democratic processes are multifaceted and open data can be used for various purposes, with diverging roles, rules and tools by citizens and public administrators. This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by an exploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory. We ﬁnd that each type of democratic process requires a different approach and open data design. We conclude that a context-sensitive open data design facilitates the transformation of raw data into meaningful information constructed collectively by public administrators and citizens.},

From an innovation perspective, we explore the current gap between the promise and practice of open government data. Based on Strategic Niche Management (SNM), we identify different phases in the open data innovation process. This study uses a living lab in a province in the Netherlands to stimulate the provision and use of open data for collaborative processes and analyses the mechanisms that condition the success of this innovation process. The results based on six interventions over a period of two years show that our interventions stimulated the use of open data and raised awareness within government, but that various mechanisms inhibited the realization of the ambitions of open government data. We conclude that the challenge of open government data as an innovation lies in finding a way to scale up the provision of open data: innovation niches are established but “regime changes” do not take place. Scaling up open government data use requires strong managerial commitment and changes in the wider organizational landscape such as constructing formal and informal rules and technological developments that stimulate debate about open data practices.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative transportation concept called Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMOD), which provides personalized services to passengers. FMOD is a demand responsive system in which a list of travel options is provided in real-time to each passenger request. The system provides passengers with ﬂexibility to choose from a menu that is optimized in an assortment optimization framework. For operators, there is ﬂexibility in terms of vehicle allocation to different service types: taxi, shared-taxi and mini-bus. The allocation of the available ﬂeet to these three services is carried out dynamically so that vehicles can change roles during the day. The FMOD system is built based on a choice model and consumer surplus is taken into account in order to improve passenger satisfaction. Furthermore, proﬁts of the operators are expected to increase since the system adapts to changing demand patterns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of FMOD and present preliminary simulation results. It is shown that the dynamic allocation of the vehicles to different services provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts over static allocation. Furthermore, it is observed that the trade-off between consumer surplus and operator’s proﬁt is critical. The optimization model is adapted in order to take into account this trade-off by controlling the level of passenger satisfaction. It is shown that with such control mechanisms FMOD provides improved results in terms of both proﬁt and consumer surplus.},

	abstract = {Limiting private cars' use while promoting sustainable modes of transport is one of the main challenges of urban transport planning. In this context, characterized by scarce resources and increasing demand for mobility, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can bridge the gap between shared low-quality public transport and unsustainable individual private transport. Taking advantage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), they can supply transport solutions ranging from flexible transit to ride sharing services, providing real-time “on demand” mobility through fleets of vehicles shared by different passengers. The optimal design of a DRST service requires a trade-off among efficiency (from the operators' point of view), service quality (from the users' point of view) and sustainability (from the community's point of view). In this paper, an agentbased model (ABM) fed with GIS data is used to explore different system configurations of a specific type of DRST service, i.e. flexible transit, and to estimate the transport demand and supply variables that make the service feasible and convenient. The model reproduces a mixed fixed/flexible route transit service with different fleet size and vehicle capacity in the city of Ragusa (Italy) with the aim to: (i) make a first test of the ABM model with GIS-based demand and road network models; (ii) explore different vehicle dispatching strategies; (iii) find appropriate indicators to monitor the service quality and efficiency. Simulation results show the impact of fleet composition and route choice strategy on the system performance. In particular, they show an optimal range of operating vehicles that minimizes a total unit cost indicator, accounting both for passenger travel time and vehicle operation cost. By reproducing the microinteraction between demand and supply agents (i.e. passengers and vehicles), it is possible to monitor the macroscopic behaviour of the system, and derive useful suggestions for the correct planning, management and optimization of DRST services.},

These have emerged as a partial response to the need of resorting to green means of transportation and to the desire of being more ﬂexible in the choice of trips, both from a spatial and a temporal point of view. On the one hand, shared mobility systems have taken advantage of the interest of riders for shared experiences. On the other hand, their success has been possible as a result of the recent advances in information and communications technology. The operational research community is already very active in this emerging ﬁeld, which provides a very rich source of new and interesting challenges, covering several planning levels, from strategic to operational ones, such as station location, station sizing, rebalancing routes. A fascinating feature of this ﬁeld is the variety of the methods used to deal with these questions. Our purpose is to survey the main problems and methods arising in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Mobility systems featuring shared vehicles are often unable to serve all potential customers, as the distribution of demand does not coincide with the positions of vehicles at any given time. System operators often choose to reposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively during the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex dynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be made, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight computation time constraints inherent to real-time decisionmaking. We first present a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that its linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing literature. We then adapt a two-stage stochastic approximation scheme from the generic SPAR algorithm due to Powell et al., in which rebalancing plans are optimized against a value function representing the expected cost (in terms of fulfilled and unfulfilled customer demand) of the future evolution of the system. The true value function is approximated by a separable function of contributions due to the rebalancing actions carried out at each station and each time step of the planning horizon. The new algorithm requires surprisingly few iterations to yield high-quality solutions, and is suited to real-time use as it can be terminated early if required. We provide insight into this good performance by examining the mathematical properties of our new flow formulation, and perform rigorous tests on standardized benchmark networks to explore the effect of system size. We then use data from Philadelphia’s public bike sharing scheme to demonstrate that the approach also yields performance gains for real systems.},

	abstract = {Ride-sharing services, that have been growing in recent years with the start of network service companies, will be further enhanced by the recently emerging trend of applications for autonomous vehicles for future traveler mobility. One fundamental question that transportation managers should address is how to capture the endogenous traffic patterns involving the new and uncertain elements facing future transportation planning and management. By concentrating on one ideal system optimal (SO) scenario, in which (i) all vehicles are autonomous, or can be centrally guided and (ii) all passengers’ pickup/drop-off trip requests can be given at the beginning, this paper aims to integrate travel demand, vehicle supply, and limited infrastructure. Available ride-shared and autonomous vehicles, from different (real/virtual) depots, can be optimally assigned to satisfy passengers’ trip requests, while considering the endogenous congestion in capacitated networks. A number of decomposition approaches are adopted in this research. Focusing on this primal problem, we propose an arc-based vehicle-based integer linear programming model in space-time-state (STS) networks, which is solved by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. From the perspective of dynamic traffic assignment, a space-time-state (STS) pathbased flow-based linear programming model is also provided as an approximation according to the mapping information between vehicle and passenger, and between a vehicle and the spacetime arc in each STS path in our priori-generated column pool. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate our decomposition approaches and their computation efficiency. From our preliminary experiments, we have a few interesting observations: (i) without considering road congestion, the network performance/efficiency could be overestimated; (ii) passengers’ required pickup and drop-off time windows could be a buffer to mitigate road congestion, without impacting system performance; (iii) the ride-sharing service could reduce the total transportation system cost under centralized control.},

Up-to-date demand models are needed to capture the impact of these policies on emerging mobility-enabled travel patterns. The study explores modeling requirements to assess the impact of such built environment policies. A synthetic population of New York City with a tour-based nested logit mode choice model was developed with accessibility to bikesharing and ride hail services via smartphone ownership. The model results suggest Manhattanites have a value of time of \$29/h, consistent with the literature. Smartphone ownership is positively influenced by income and negatively influenced by age, and in turn negatively impacts Citi Bike ridership relative to other modes available. The synthetic population is also applied to analyze two city-scale built environment scenarios: a hypothetical Amazon headquarter deployment and a Citi Bike service expansion. If Amazon succeeded in Long Island City, it would have increased the number of trips to/from that neighborhood by 239\%, of which FHVs would grow by over 441\% and transit by 294\%. It would have led to an increase of peak morning trips from 5000 up to at least 8000. Citi Bike’s expansion plan would grow ridership by 92\%, and if they were able to expand efficiently throughout NYC this would grow further to 210\% over the baseline.},

In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to ‘grow’ pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.},

The proposed model aims at understanding the economic structure of a city, in order to simulate the urban goods movements depending of the activity using an existing mode. This model’s main function is to simulate the number of establishments by category of size and field of activity for a given zone, or to build evolution scenarios from a starting situation. Starting from a known structure (or simulated through SIMETAB), it is possible to make the economic structure of a city evolve. This feature allows decision makers to forecast the impacts of alterations of the urban framework in the future, from basic data such as population and employment statistics.},

This article reviews prior research on AVs and society, and articulates future needs. Research to assess future societal change induced by AVs has grown dramatically in recent years. The critical challenge in assessing the societal implications of AVs is forecasting how consumers and businesses will use them. Researchers are predicting the future use of AVs by consumers through stated preference surveys, finding analogs in current behaviors, utility optimization models, and/or staging empirical “AV-equivalent” experiments. While progress is being made, it is important to recognize that potential behavioral change induced by AVs is massive in scope and that forecasts are difficult to validate. For example, AVs could result in many consumers abandoning private vehicles for ride-share services, vastly increased travel by minors, the elderly and other groups unable to drive, and/or increased recreation and commute miles driven due to increased utility of in-vehicle time. We argue that significantly increased efforts are needed from the AVs and society research community to ensure 1) the important behavioral changes are analyzed and 2) models are explicitly evaluated to characterize and reduce uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The preferences of travelers determines the utility of daily activity plans. Decision-makers can affect the preference of travelers when they force private car users to use park-and-ride (P\&R) facilities as a way of decreasing traffic in city centers. The P\&R system has been shown to be effective in reducing uninterrupted increases in traffic congestion, especially in city centers. Therefore, the impacts of P\&R on travel behavior and the daily activity plans of both worker and shopper travelers were studied in this paper. Moreover, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a promising technology for the coming decade. A simulation of the AV as part of a multimodal system, when the P\&R system was integrated in the daily activity plans, was carried out to determine the required AV fleet size needed to fulfill a certain demand and to study the impacts of AVs on the behavior of travelers (trip time and distance). Specifically, a group of travelers, who use private cars as their transport mode, was studied, and certain modifications to their daily activity plans, including P\&R facilities and changing their transport mode, were introduced. Using the MATSim open-source tool, four scenarios were simulated based on the mentioned modifications. The four scenarios included (1) a simulation of the existing transport modes of the travelers, (2) a simulation of their daily activity plans when their transport modes were changed to AVs, (3) a simulation of the travelers, when P\&R facilities were included in their activity chain plans, and (4) a simulation of their daily activity plans, when both P\&R and AVs were included in their activity chain plans. The result showed that using the P\&R system increased overall travel time, compared with using a private car. The results also demonstrated that using AVs as a replacement for conventional cars reduced travel time. In conclusion, the impact of P\&R and AVs on the travel behavior of certain travelers was evaluated in this paper.},

	abstract = {A self-driving, fully automated, or “autonomous” vehicle (AV) revolution is imminent, with the potential to eliminate driver costs and driver error, while ushering in an era of shared mobility. Dynamic ride-sharing (DRS), which refers to sharing rides with strangers en route, is growing, with top transportation network companies providing such services. This work uses an agent-based simulation tool called MATSim to simulate travel patterns in Austin, Texas in the presence of personal AVs, and shared AVs (SAVs), with DRS and advanced road-pricing policies in place. Fleet size, pricing, and fare level impacts are analyzed in depth to provide insight into how SAVs may best be introduced to a city or region. Results indicate that the cost-effectiveness of traveling with strangers overcomes inconvenience and privacy issues at moderate-to-low fare levels, with high fares being more detrimental than the base case. A moderately sized Austin, Texas fleet (one SAV for every 25 people) serves nearly 30\% of all trips made during the day. The average vehicle occupancy of this fleet was around 1.48 [after including the 12.7\% of SAV vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) empty/without passengers], with a 4.5\% increase in VMT. This same fleet performs better when road-pricing is enforced in the peak periods (4 h a day), moderating VMT by 2\%, increasing SAV demand and in turn fleet-manager revenue. SAVs are able to earn around \$100 per SAV per day even after paying tolls, but only at low-fare levels.},

	abstract = {More than half of the global population is currently under strict forms of social distancing, with more than 90 countries in lockdown, including France. Estimating the expected impact of the lockdown, and the potential effectiveness of different exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in the Île-de-France region to (i) assess the current epidemic situation, (ii) evaluate the expected impact of the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020, and (iii) estimate the effectiveness of possible exit strategies. The model is calibrated on hospital admission data of the region before lockdown and validated on syndromic and virological surveillance data. Different types and durations of social distancing interventions are simulated, including a progressive lifting of the lockdown targeted on specific classes of individuals (e.g. allowing a larger proportion of the population to go to work, while protecting the elderly), and large-scale testing. We estimate the basic reproductive number at 3.0 [2.8, 3.2] (95\% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and the population infected by COVID-19 as of April 5 to be in the range 1\% to 6\%. The average number of contacts is predicted to be reduced by 80\% during lockdown, leading to a substantial reduction of the reproductive number (

Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave largely overwhelming the healthcare system. Extensive case-finding, testing and isolation are required to envision social distancing strategies that gradually relax current constraints (larger fraction of individuals going back to work, progressive reopening of activities), while keeping schools closed and seniors isolated. As France faces the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.},

	title = {Mobility traces and spreading of {COVID}-19},
	url = {http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045302},
	abstract = {We use human mobility models, for which we are experts, and attach a virus infection dynamics to it, for which we are not experts but have taken it from the literature, including recent publications. This results in a virus spreading dynamics model. The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. 

Recommendations for improvement are welcome. We come to the following conclusions:
1. Complete lockdown works. About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down. This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown.
2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10\% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights:
a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed.
b. There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown. Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large.
c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements.
3. Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics. It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier.
4. Infections in public transport play an important role. In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20\%. Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known. -- This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates.
5. In our simulations, removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces, leisure activities, and in public transport may barely have been sufficient to control the infection dynamics if implemented early on. Now according to our simulations it is too late for this, and (even) harsher measures will have to be initiated until possibly a return to such a restrictive, but still somewhat functional regime will again be possible.

Evidently, all of these results have to be taken with care. They are based on preliminary infection parameters taken from the literature, used inside a model that has more transport/movement details than all others that we are aware of but still not enough to describe all aspects of reality, and suffer from having to write computer code under time pressure. Optimally, they should be confirmed independently. Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for "complete lockdown" at the latest when about 10\% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities).

What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e. tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine. The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful. Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all. We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime.

When opening up after lockdown, it would be important to know the true fraction of people who are already immune, since that would slow down the infection dynamics by itself. For Wuhan, the currently available numbers report that only about 0.1\% of the population was infected, which would be very far away from "herd immunity". However, there have been and still may be many unknown infections.},

Thus, correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for studying large-scale spatial transmission of infectious diseases and improving epidemic control. In this study, a large-scale agent-based transport simulation (MATSim) is linked with a generic epidemic spread model to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban environment. The use of an agent-based model allows reproduction of the real-world behavior of individuals’ daily path in an urban setting and allows the capture of interactions among them, in the form of a spatial-temporal social network. This model is used to study seasonal influenza outbreaks in the metropolitan area of Zurich, Switzerland. The observations of the agent-based models are compared with results from classical SIR models. The model presented is a prototype that can be used to analyze multiple scenarios in the case of a disease spread at an urban scale, considering variations of different model parameters settings. The results of this simulation can help to improve comprehension of the disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic.},

The adaptation of freight models to the urban environment strongly relies on an eﬃcient unit of observation, which is introduced as the spine of the model after discussing the main approaches of urban freight transport modelling. The main features of the model are then presented from the generation to the distribution of freight operations and are confronted to elements of validation. The robustness of the model is also discussed through time by analysing elements of its initial calibration 20 years ago and the latest results of urban freight surveys in order to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. We show that the model is able to summarize eﬃciently the urban freight transport phenomenon and is still statistically robust twenty years after its ﬁrst design although it needs marginal adaptations on organisational elements.},

This is the combined result of light and heavy goods vehicles emitting more than private cars, and of freight traﬃc being more spatially concentrated (within the city center) than passenger traﬃc, thereby aﬀecting more population. All in all, the environmental cost of urban road freight is around 2.1 billion € per year. Some policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Structural changes in social, economic and political systems influence the transport demand at infrastructural level, just as individual decisions of road users have an impact on the structures of these systems. The dynamics of these systems are usually observed in a long-term horizon. Behavioural changes and decision-making processes of individual, heterogeneous road users at spatial, infrastructural level can only be examined in a short-term horizon. The developed feedback approach between a Macroscopic Extrapolation (MEP) and a Microscopic Transport Simulation (MTS) is so far the only transport modelling approach, which considers different dynamical systems. This modelling instrument enables a strategic transport forecast for a long-term horizon and does not lose beyond the spatial context. The long-term, structural changes of the overall system are illustrated by MEP, the MTS, however, shows short-term changes in decisions of road users at infrastructural level. By MTS, the spatial context is used to adapt the spatially influenced parameters in the MEP. By contrast, the MEP serves to update the constraints and spatial structures in the MTS. As a result, the two dynamics simulations are fed back to each other for mutual adaption. The present research work demonstrates the basic functionality of the developed, strategic modelling instrument. The approach is suitable to analyse the behaviour of large, complex transport systems at aggregated and disaggregated levels in a long-term horizon. The approach does not only use different levels of aggregation and accordingly works with two different analysis measures, it also takes into account two temporal observation horizons. In addition, this approach enables to assess the effects of external constraints, such as political interventions, on the observed transport system in a long-term horizon at aggregated level, but also point-in-time at infrastructural level. The operability of the developed approach is demonstrated in the framework of a case example focussing on the courier, express and parcel (CEP market) in Berlin. For this purpose, the System Dynamics (SD) approach developed by Forrester (1958) is used as a MEP. In addition, the microscopic, agent-based transport simulation MATSim developed by Balmer et al. (2009) is used as a MTS. The formalisation, parametrisation and calibration of the feedback approach concerning the case example is shown in detail. Besides to the basis scenario for long-term forecasting CEP transport in Berlin, measure scenarios are developed, which extend the observed system with selected transport policy and logistics measures to regulate the CEP transport in urban areas. These are the measures package stations, distance toll and cordon toll. Finally, the simulation results of the developed Strategic Transport Forecast are evaluated and discussed. In this context, the results of the measure scenarios are compared with the results of the basis scenario to show the effects of the selected measures on the overall system CEP transport in urban areas.},

Earlier studies suggest that shifts may occur towards heavy vehicles, due to the relative inefficiency of lighter vehicles types. However, these studies have not taken into account the effects of changes in shipment size, as a response to pricing measures. Also, these studies have not considered emission-class dependent charges. Thirdly, no empirical disaggregate models or studies are available for the Netherlands for this problem. We present a discrete choice model for the joint choice of vehicle type and shipment size, estimated on a large dataset of disaggregate carrier freight trip data. The model explains variations in vehicle type choice for different transport purposes and contexts (e.g. commodity type, long-haul, urban transport, to/from logistic nodes). The analysis of emission based truck charging schemes shows that substitution towards low emission vehicles can be expected within the same vehicle class. It is also not likely that the truck charge will lead to a significant increase of shipment sizes or to substitution between vehicle types: a distance based truck charge increases transport costs but inventory costs restrain a shift to larger shipment sizes. This result points to a limited capability of supply chains to absorb transport cost increases by logistics re-organisation.},

In this work we empirically determine space–time constraints from the Chilean household and travel survey. Based on a speciﬁc activity pattern example, where trips are made from home to work to a discretionary activity and back home, we estimate detour factors. Detour factors describe the spatial deviations that are made from the home-work axis to conduct the discretionary activity. Using GIS we estimate potential path areas (PPAs), where discretionary activities may be located. Within the PPAs, applying a time constraint that is the maximum daily travel time reﬁnes the selection of discretionary activity locations. The thresholds of the daily travel time vary according to the PPA-size and mode combinations. We were able to reproduce between 38\% and 72\% of the discretionary location choices observed in the survey (according to the rigor of the constraints applied).},

We ﬁnd that the methods have been used not only in the core originating ﬁelds of travel behaviour and transport geography, but also in health, criminology and demography, and are growing fastest in health. The methods have been applied to a number of purposes with applications to accessibility the most common and the fastest growing. Demonstrated interest in these methods, along with the technologies and data to facilitate them, suggests a bright future for the use of PPAs and ASs in the social sciences.},

	abstract = {Ha¨gerstrand’s original framework of time geography and the subsequent time–space prism computational methods form the foundation of a new computational method for potential path areas (PPA) in a realistic representation of dynamic urban environments. In this paper the time–space prism framework is used to assess sensitivity of PPA size to different parameters and to build choice sets for regional destination choice models. We explain the implication of different parameters to choice set formation in a step-wise manner and illustrate not only the complexity of the idea and the high computational demand but also behavioral realism. In this context, this paper tests the feasibility of using constraint-based time–space prism to ﬁnd the choice sets for a large-scale destination choice model, and identiﬁes a variety of implementation issues. Computational demand is estimated based on a household travel survey for the Southern California Association of Government, and the feasibility of using time–space prisms for destination choice models is assessed with different levels of information on the network and destinations available. The implications of time of day effects and ﬂexibility in scheduling on choice set development due to varying level of service on the network and availability of activity opportunities are discussed and numerically assessed.},

	abstract = {Ride-hailing is a clear initial market for autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) because it features high vehicle utilization levels and strong incentive to cut down labor costs. An extensive and reliable network of recharging infrastructure is the prerequisite to launch a lucrative AEV ridehailing fleet. Hence, it is necessary to estimate the charging infrastructure demands for an AEV fleet in advance. This study proposes a charging system planning framework for a shared-use AEV fleet providing ride-hailing services in urban area. We first adopt an agent-based simulation model, called BEAM, to describe the complex behaviors of both passengers and transportation systems in urban cities. BEAM simulates the driving, parking and charging behaviors of the AEV fleet with range constraints and identifies times and locations of their charging demands. Then, based on BEAM simulation outputs, we adopt a hybrid algorithm to site and size charging stations to satisfy the charging demands subject to quality of service requirements. Based on the proposed framework, we estimate the charging infrastructure demands and calculate the corresponding economics and carbon emission impacts of electrifying a ride-hailing AEV fleet in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also investigate the impacts of various AEV and charging system parameters, e.g., fleet size, vehicle battery capacity and rated power of chargers, on the ride-hailing system’s overall costs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00996},
	abstract = {Computer simulations are used in virtually all fields of applied science and engineering to predict the behaviour of complex systems. In the context of uncertainty quantification and optimization, a large number of simulations are usually necessary, which may become intractable for high-fidelity numerical models. This problem is even more severe when it comes to stochastic simulators, which do not provide a deterministic outcome for a given set of input parameters, but rather a realization of a random variable. In a recent paper, we developed a novel surrogate model for stochastic simulators. In that framework, the response distribution is assumed to be a generalized lambda distribution. The associated distribution parameters are cast as functions of input variables and represented by polynomial chaos expansions. In this paper, we propose a new fitting procedure to construct such a surrogate model, which combines the maximum conditional likelihood estimation with (modified) feasible generalized least-squares. This method does not require repeated model evaluations for the same input parameters, so it is more versatile than the existing replication-based approaches. We compare the new method with the state-of-the-art nonparametric kernel estimator on two analytical examples and case studies. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated in terms of the accuracy of both the response distribution approximation and statistical quantities depending on the specific focus of the application.},

	abstract = {This paper used an implementation of the land-use model SILO in Austin, Texas, over a 27-year period with an aim to understand the impacts of the full adoption of self-driving vehicles on the region’s residential land use. SILO was integrated with MATSim for the Austin region. Land-use and travel results were generated for a business-as-usual case (BAU) of 0\% self-driving or “autonomous” vehicles (AVs) over the model timeframe versus a scenario in which households’ value of travel time savings (VTTS) was reduced by 50\% to reflect the travel-burden reductions of no longer having to drive. A third scenario was also compared and examined against BAU to understand the impacts of rising vehicle occupancy (VO) and/or higher roadway capacities due to dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) options in shared AV (SAV) fleets. Results suggested an 8.1\% increase in average work-trip times when VTTS fell by 50\% and VO remained unaffected (the 100\% AV scenario) and a 33.3\% increase in the number of households with “extreme work-trips” (over 1 hour, each way) in the final model year (versus BAU of 0\% AVs). When VO was raised to 2.0 and VTTS fell instead by 25\% (the “Hi-DRS” SAV scenario), average work-trip times increased by 3.5\% and the number of households with “extreme work-trips” increased by 16.4\% in the final model year (versus BAU of 0\% AVs). The model also predicted 5.3\% fewer households and 19.1\% more available, developable land in the city of Austin in the 100\% AV scenario in the final model year relative to the BAU scenario’s final year, with 5.6\% more households and 10.2\% less developable land outside the city. In addition, the model results predicted 5.6\% fewer households and 62.9\% more available developable land in the city of Austin in the Hi-DRS SAV scenario in the final model year relative to the BAU scenario’s final year, with 6.2\% more households and 9.9\% less developable land outside the city.},

	abstract = {Driverless vehicles have the potential to significantly affect the transport system, society, and environment. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding what the development will look like, and there are several contradictory forces. This paper addresses the effects of driverless vehicles by combining the results from 26 simulation studies. Each simulation study focuses on a particular case, e.g. a certain mobility concept or geographical region. By combining and analysing the results from the 26 simulation studies, an overall picture of the effects of driverless vehicles is presented. In the paper, the following perspectives are considered: what types of application of driverless vehicles have been studied in literature; what effects these simulation studies predict; and what research gaps still exist related to the effects of driverless vehicles. The analysis shows that it is primarily driverless taxi applications in urban areas that have been studied. Some parameters, such as trip cost and waiting time, show small variations between the simulation studies. Other parameters, such as vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT), show larger variations and depend heavily on the assumptions concerning value of time and level of sharing. To increase the understanding of system level effects of driverless vehicles, simulations of more complex applications and aspects such as land use, congestion and energy consumption are considered.},

	abstract = {Fleets of shared Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) could replace private cars by providing a taxi-like service but at a cost similar to driving a private car. On the one hand, large Autonomous Taxi (AT) fleets may result in increased road capacity and lower demand for parking spaces. On the other hand, an increase in vehicle trips is very likely, as travelling becomes more convenient and affordable, and additionally, ATs need to drive unoccupied between requests. This study evaluates the impact of a city-wide introduction of ATs on traffic congestion. The analysis is based on a multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) of Berlin (Germany) and the neighbouring Brandenburg area. The central focus is on precise simulation of both real-time AT operation and mixed autonomous/conventional vehicle traffic flow. Different ratios of replacing private car trips with AT trips are used to estimate the possible effects at different stages of introducing such services. The obtained results suggest that large fleets operating in cities may have a positive effect on traffic if road capacity increases according to current predictions. ATs will practically eliminate traffic congestion, even in the city centre, despite the increase in traffic volume. However, given no flow capacity improvement, such services cannot be introduced on a large scale, since the induced additional traffic volume will intensify today’s congestion.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of mobility-on-demand fleets increases the importance to understand the impact of mobility-on-demand fleets on transportation networks and how to regulate them. For this purpose, transportation network simulations are required to contain corresponding routing methods. We study the trade-off between computational efficiency and routing accuracy of different approaches to routing fleets in a dynamic network simulation with endogenous edge travel times: a computationally cheap but less accurate Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) based method and a more typical Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) based method. The NFD-based approach models network dynamics with a network travel time factor that is determined by the current average network speed and scales free-flow travel times. We analyze the different computational costs of the approaches in a case study for 10,000 origin-destination (OD) pairs in a network of the city of Munich, Germany that reveals speedup factors in the range of 100. The trade-off for this is less accurate travel time estimations for individual OD pairs. Results indicate that the NFD-based approach overestimates the DTA-based travel times, especially when the network is congested. Adjusting the network travel time factor based on pre-processed DTA  results, the NFD-based routing approach represents a computationally very efficient methodology that also captures traffic dynamics in an aggregated way.},

	title = {On the interplay between self-driving cars and public transportation: {A} game-theoretic perspective},
	abstract = {Cities worldwide struggle with overloaded transportation systems and their externalities, such as traﬃc congestion and emissions. The emerging technology of autonomous transportation systems bears a high potential to alleviate these issues. At the same time, this technology might also introduce negative eﬀects, in particular by disproportionately cannibalizing public transportation. A careful analysis of this trade-oﬀ requires modeling both modes of transportation within a uniﬁed framework. In this paper, we propose such a framework, which allows us to study the interplay among mobility service providers, public transport authorities, and customers, and in particular to analyze the eﬀect of autonomous ride-hailing services on the demand for public transportation. This framework combines a graph-theoretic network model for the transportation system with a game-theoretic model whereby mobility service providers are proﬁt-maximizers and customers select individually-optimal transportation options. We apply our modeling approach to data for the city of Berlin, Germany and present sensitivity analyses to study factors that mobility service providers or municipalities can act upon to strategically steer the overall system. We show that depending on market conditions and policy restrictions, autonomous ride-hailing systems may complement or cannibalize a public transportation system, and discuss the main factors behind such diﬀerent outcomes as well as strategic design options available to policymakers.},

	abstract = {Mobility-on-demand systems consisting of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are expected to improve the efﬁciency of urban mobility through reduced vehicle ownership and parking demand. However, several issues in their implementation remain open, such as unifying the vehicle and ride-sharing assignment with rebalancing non-occupied vehicles. Furthermore, proposed SAV systems are evaluated in isolation from other trafﬁc; no congestion is taken into account when assigning requests or calculating routes. To address this gap, we present Shared Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system (SAMoD), a reinforcement learning-based approach to vehicle relocation and ride-sharing request assignment. Each vehicle learns its pick-up and rebalancing behaviour based on local current and observed historical demand. We evaluate SAMoD on Manhattan network using NYC taxi data in microsimulator SUMO. We investigate SAMoD performance in the presence of congestion generated by private vehicles, as well as investigate impact of different percentages of SAMoD vehicles in the system on overall trafﬁc network performance.},

	abstract = {The design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the design of AV-enabled mobility systems are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of AVs would impact their design and deployment process, whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation management decisions. This calls for tools to study such a coupling and co-design AVs and AV-enabled mobility systems in terms of different objectives. In this paper, we instantiate a framework to address such co-design problems. In particular, we leverage the recently developed theory of co-design to frame and solve the problem of designing and deploying an intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system, whereby AVs service travel demands jointly with public transit, in terms of fleet sizing, vehicle autonomy, and public transit service frequency. Our framework is modular and compositional, allowing one to describe the design problem as the interconnection of its individual components and to tackle it from a system-level perspective. To showcase our methodology, we present a real-world case study for Washington D.C., USA. Our work suggests that it is possible to create user-friendly optimization tools to systematically assess costs and benefits of interventions, and that such analytical techniques might gain a momentous role in policy-making in the future.},

We begin by describing the system using a dynamic fluid model to show the existence and stability of an equilibrium (i.e., load balance) through pricing policies. We then develop an optimization framework that allows us to find optimal policies in terms of pricing and rebalancing. We first maximize profit by only using pricing policies, then incorporate rebalancing, and finally we consider whether the solution is found sequentially or jointly. We apply each approach on a data-driven case study using real taxi data from New York City. Depending on which benchmarking solution we use, the joint problem (i.e., pricing and rebalancing) increases profits by 7\% to 40\%},

	abstract = {Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) have been steadily increasing the share of total trips in metropolitan areas across the world. Micro-modeling TNC operation is essential for large-scale transportation systems simulation. In this study, an agent-based approach for analyzing supply and demand aspects of ride-sourcing operation is done using POLARIS, a high-performance simulation tool. On the demand side, a mode-choice model for the agent and a vehicle-ownership model that informs this choice are developed. On the supply side, TNC vehicle-assignment strategies, pick-up and drop-off operations, and vehicle repositioning are modeled with congestion feedback, an outcome of the mesoscopic traffic simulation. Two case studies of Bloomington and Chicago in Illinois are used to study the framework’s computational speed for large-scale operations and the effect of TNC fleets on a region’s congestion patterns. Simulation results show that a zone-based vehicle-assignment strategy scales better than relying on matching closest vehicles to requests. For large regions like Chicago, large fleets are seen to be detrimental to congestion, especially in a future in which more travelers will use TNCs. From an operational point of view, an efficient relocation strategy is critical for large regions with concentrated demand, but not regulating repositioning can worsen empty travel and, consequently, congestion. The TNC simulation framework developed in this study is of special interest to cities and regions, since it can be used to model both demand and supply aspects for large regions at scale, and in reasonably low computational time.},

	abstract = {Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (
              i
              ) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (
              ii
              ) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ∼3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.},

Rather, such questions are more and more focused on how such technologies will impact evolving transportation systems, our social world, and the individuals who live within it and whether such systems ought to be fully automated or remain under some form of direct human control. More importantly, how will mobility itself change as these independent operational vehicles first share and then dominate our roadways? How will the public be kept apprised of their evolving capacities, and what will be the impact of science and the communication of scientific advances across the varying forms of social media on these developments? We look here to address these issues and to provide some suggestions for the problems that are currently emerging.},

	abstract = {Land use–transportation interaction models can be useful planning support systems to assess the long-term implications of emerging transportation technologies like mobility-on-demand and automated vehicles. We propose an agent-based simulation framework ( SimMobility Long-Term) that uses econometrically robust behavioral models to model the potential impacts of accessibility changes in “car-lite” communities on the choice of housing-mobility bundles. Residential relocation and private mobility holding decisions are jointly considered in a sequential simulation modeling approach. Different types of market responses to the car-lite pilot are modeled through various scenarios via assumptions of changes in model parameters, and compared to a baseline where the car-lite pilot is never implemented. A comparatively vehicle-free study area with a low vacancy rate is chosen to obtain conservative estimates of policy impacts. Our findings indicate that initial awareness of the pilot is quite effective in making the study area more vehicle-free relative to the baseline. However, as market effects start impacting housing prices and bidding results, the vehicle-free gains are significantly reduced due to neighborhood gentrification. In conclusion, we highlight how land use–transportation interaction models can be used to explore market dynamics to see where market pressures matter, along with the need to align car-lite policies with market conditions regarding vacancy and car ownership rates.},

	abstract = {Synthetic population is a key input to agent-based urban/transportation microsimulation models. The objective of population synthesis is to reproduce the underlying statistical properties of real population based on available microsamples and marginal distributions. However, characterizing the joint associations among a large set of attributes is challenging because of the curse of dimensionality, in particular when attributes are organized in a hierarchical household-individual structure. In this paper, we use a hierarchical mixture model to characterize the joint distribution of both household and individual attributes. Based on this model, we propose a framework of generating representative household structures in population synthesis. The framework integrates three models: (1) probabilistic tensor factorization, (2) multilevel latent class model, and (3) rejection sampling. With this framework, one can generalize not only the associations of within- and cross-level attributes, but also reproduce structural relationships among household members (e.g., husband-wife). As a case study, we implement this framework based on the household interview travel survey (HITS) data of Singapore, and then use the inferred model to generate a synthetic population pool. This model demonstrates great potential in reproducing the underlying statistical distribution of real population. The generated synthetic population can serve as a replacement for census in developing agent-based models, with privacy and conﬁdentiality being protected and preserved.},

	abstract = {Use of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) for last-mile transportation can improve transit use and reduce road congestion. We investigate the problem of optimal integration of SAVs with transit. By optimal, we mean that transit should be used instead of or to complement SAVs only when it reduces the total system travel time. Although greater use of transit reduces congestion, transit often increases travel time due to frequent stops and transfers. By using a continuous approximation to passenger and vehicle movements, we formulate the problem as a linear program using the link transmission model for traffic flow. One of the main challenges is associating passenger movement with vehicles that can have different destinations (e.g. a transit stop). Although the mathematical program is linear, it nevertheless has a large number of variables. We find a suboptimal solution using a rolling horizon method, which greatly reduces the required computation time. We also demonstrate an example of a possibly unfair passenger-to-vehicle ordering, and propose a first-come-first-served greedy algorithm to match passengers. A suite of experimental results on the Sioux Falls network show that using transit decreases total system travel time, especially when SAV fleet sizes are small. Transit also decreases the time travelers spend waiting, but tends to increase in-vehicle travel time. The methodology could be useful both for future SAV operators and for planners seeking to predict the effects of SAVs on traffic congestion.},

The service relies on space and time aggregation of passengers that have similar origins and destinations. It provides a point-to-point service with predefined pick-up and drop-off locations. In this way, detours to pick-up en-route passengers is avoided. The optimization problem that minimizes the fleet size along with limiting rebalancing distances is defined as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Solving the problem for Zurich, Switzerland, yields, in the best case, a fleet size equal to 3.7\% of the current fleet that could serve current car demand. Vehicle kilometers traveled could also be reduced by nearly 10\%. Results also show that the speed of automated vehicles has a substantial effect on the necessary fleet size and free-flow speeds generally produce over-optimistic results.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new concept of urban shared-taxi services. The proposed system has a new organisational design and pricing scheme that aims to use the capacity in traditional taxi services in a more efﬁcient way. In this system, a taxi acting in ‘sharing’ mode offers lower prices to its clients, in exchange for them to accept sharing the vehicle with other persons who have compatible trips (time and space). The paper proposes and tests an agent-based simulation model in which a set of rules for space and time matching between a request of a client and the candidate shared taxis is identiﬁed. It considers that the client is only willing to accept a maximum deviation from his or her direct route and establishes an objective function for selecting the best candidate taxi. The function considers the minimum travel time combination of pickup and drop-off of all the pool of clients sharing each taxi while allowing to establish a policy of bonuses to competing taxis with certain number of occupants. An experiment for the city of Lisbon is presented with the objectives of testing the proposed simulation conceptual model and showing the potential of sharing taxis for improving mobility management in urban areas. Results show that the proposed system may lead to signiﬁcant fare and travel time savings to passengers, while not jeopardising that much the taxi revenues.

It is perceived to be a viable alternative to classical modes of transportation, and receives a great deal of political support from transport planners. However, not much objective information is available on ridesharing behaviors. We use travel survey data to study the evolution of the ridesharing market in an urban area. Our study is based on data from four large-scale OD surveys conducted in the Greater Montreal Area (1987, 1993, 1998 and 2003).In the latest survey conducted in Montreal, car passengers were asked to identify the driver who gave them the opportunity to travel in this way. Their answers were classiﬁed according to the type of driver; for instance, a member of their household, a neighbor or a co-worker. We use this information to calibrate a model matching car passengers and car drivers belonging to the same household. This will be referred to as IHHR (intra-household ridesharing).Preliminary results reveal that approximately 70\% of all trips made by car passengers are the result of IHHR. Furthermore, around 15\% of those trips are questionable, in that they were exclusively generated for another individual’s purposes, consequently generating an additional trip for the journey back home. Moreover, this percentage increased over time. Objective data regarding ridesharing and its evolution in an urban area will undoubtedly help decision makers gain a clearer proﬁle of this means of travel and help to realign attitudes on the issue.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of the sharing economy attaining more popularity, there has been a shift toward shared-use mobility services in recent years, especially those that encourage users to share their personal vehicles with others. To date, different variants of these services have been proposed that call for different settings and give rise to different research questions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) ride sharing is one such service that provides a platform for drivers to share their personal trips with riders who have similar itineraries. Unlike ride-sourcing services, drivers in P2P ride sharing have their own individual trips to make and are not driving for the sole purpose of serving rider requests. Unlike traditional carpooling, P2P ride sharing can serve on-demand and one-time trip requests. P2P ride sharing has been identiﬁed as a sustainable mode of transportation that results in several individual and societal beneﬁts. The core of a P2P ride-sharing system is a ride-matching problem that determines ride-sharing plans for users. This paper reviews the major studies on the operations of P2P ride-sharing systems, with a focus on modeling and solution methodologies for matching, routing, and scheduling. In this paper, we classify ridesharing systems based on their operational features and review the existing methodologies for each class. We further discuss a number of important directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Ridesharing has been emerging as a new type of mobility. However, the early promises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined by a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services and the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of competition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model cooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a real-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated combination of DialA-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning incoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP), which assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of the vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive approaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of Mobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality following closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of information the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic model of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case bounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on one-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping with noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and preferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated. The computational results suggest that cooperation among ridesharing companies can be conducted in such a way to limit the degradation of the level of service with respect to a centralized model. Finally, we argue that the competition can lower the quality of the ridesharing service, especially in the case customer preferences are accommodated.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel, computational efficient, dynamic ridesharing algorithm. The beneficial computational properties of the algorithm arise from casting the ridesharing problem as a linear assignment problem between fleet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster than the stateof-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases the ability of state-of-the-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large fleets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the benefits of ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets, the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing offers clear benefits with respect to more traditional taxi fleets in terms of level of service, even if one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a proportion of the fleet size and customer requests. This could make real-time urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios where companies have predefined market shares, we show that the number of vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative effects of multi-company ridesharing.},

We establish both process-level and steady-state convergence of the queueing network to a ﬂuid limit in a large market regime where demand for rides and supply of cars tend to inﬁnity and use this limit to study a ﬂuid-based optimization problem. We prove that the optimal network utility obtained from the ﬂuid-based optimization is an upper bound on the utility in the ﬁnite car system for any routing policy, both static and dynamic, under which the closed queueing network has a stationary distribution. This upper bound is achieved asymptotically under the ﬂuid-based optimal routing policy. Simulation results with real-world data released by Didi Chuxing demonstrate the beneﬁt of using the ﬂuid-based optimal routing policy compared with various other policies.},

	abstract = {This study models a multi-modal network with ridesharing services. The developed model reproduces the scenario where travelers with their own cars may choose to be a solo-driver, a ridesharing driver, a ridesharing rider, or a public transit passenger while travelers without their own cars can only choose to be either a ridesharing rider or a public transit passenger. The developed model can capture the (clock) time-dependent choices of travelers and the evolution of traffic conditions, i.e., the within-day traffic dynamics. In particular, the within-day traffic dynamics in a city region is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation, i.e., the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). This paper further develops a doubly dynamical system that examines how the within-day time-dependent travelers’ choices and traffic conditions will evolve from day to day, i.e., the day-to-day dynamics. Based on the doubly dynamical framework, this paper proposes two different congestion pricing schemes that aim to reduce network congestion and improve traffic efficiency. One scheme is to price all vehicles including both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles (for ridesharing trips, the price is shared by the driver and rider), while the other scheme prices the solo-driving vehicles only in order to encourage ridesharing. The pricing levels (under each scheme) can be determined either through an adaptive adjustment mechanism from period to period driven by observed traffic conditions, or through solving a bi-level optimization problem. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the models and effectiveness of the pricing schemes. The results indicate that the emerging ridesharing platform may not necessarily reduce traffic congestion, but the proposed congestion pricing schemes can effectively reduce congestion and improve system performance. While pricing solo-driving vehicles only may encourage ridesharing, it can be less effective in reducing the overall congestion when compared to pricing both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles.},

Centralized (binary integer programming) and decentralized (dynamic auction-based multi-agent) optimization algorithms are formulated to match passengers and drivers. Numerical experiments on the decentralized approach provides near optimal solutions for single-driver, single-passenger cases with lower computational burden. The decentralized approach is then extended to accommodate both multi-passenger and multi-driver matches. The results indicate higher user cost savings and vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) savings when allowing multi-passenger rides. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the impact of the service provider commission rate on revenue and system reliability. While short term revenue can be maximized at a commission rate of roughly 50\% of each trip’s cost, the resulting drop in system reliability would be expected to reduce patronage and revenues in the longer term.},

	abstract = {Ridesharing offers the opportunity to make more efﬁcient use of vehicles while preserving the beneﬁts of individual mobility. Presenting ridesharing as a viable option for commuters, however, requires minimizing certain inconvenience factors. One of these factors includes detours which result from picking up and dropping off additional passengers. This paper proposes a method which aims to best utilize ridesharing potential while keeping detours below a speciﬁc limit. The method speciﬁcally targets ridesharing systems on a very large scale and with a high degree of dynamics which are difﬁcult to address using classical approaches known from operations research. For this purpose, the road network is divided into distinct partitions which deﬁne the search space for ride matches. The size and shape of the partitions depend on the topology of the road network as well as on two free parameters. This allows optimizing the partitioning with regard to sharing potential utilization and inconvenience minimization. Match making is ultimately performed using an agent-based approach. As a case study, the algorithm is applied to investigate the potential for taxi sharing in Singapore. This is done by considering about 110 000 daily trips and allowing up to two sharing partners. The outcome shows that the number of trips could be reduced by 42\% resulting in a daily mileage savings of 230 000 km. It is further shown that the presented approach exceeds the mileage savings achieved by a greedy heuristic by 6\% while requiring 30\% lower computational efforts.},

In this study, we propose to use AVs for solving the first-mile (FM) problem that aims to transport passengers from their homes to metro stations. Passengers submit travel requests in advance and a fleet operator dispatches AVs and arranges ridesharing in a rolling horizon framework. The ridesharing is implemented by assigning one AV to serve several requests subject to the vehicle capacity, the maximum travel time, and the accessibility constraints. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to determine the AV dispatch and ridesharing schemes for the minimum operational costs. Then, another MILP model with the objective of the maximum user satisfaction is formulated for the purpose of comparison. A cluster-based solution method is designed to deal with the large-scale FM problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. Results show that ridesharing can reduce both required AV fleet size and vehicle traveled miles. The proposed solution method is able to solve the problem efficiently and fulfil the requirement of online computation.},

It outlines transferrable procedures and methods that can be used to process smartcard data and to deﬁne, identify and visualize low-demand transit routes. In an empirical study, it shows that some low-demand transit routes can probably be replaced by Uber at a lower level of overall costs. But the empirical study also indicates that the replacement can be challenging in reality given issues such as unwillingness or diﬃculties of local transit agencies and ride-sharing service providers in sharing ﬁnancial information regarding their services, latent demand for private ride-sharing services, social equity and political/legal concerns over the introduction of private ride-sharing services into the transitservice market and usage of public funding for residents/riders to use private ride-sharing services.},

	abstract = {A dynamic ridesharing system is a platform that connects drivers who use their personal vehicles to travel with riders who are in need of transportation, on a short notice. Since each driver/rider may have several potential matches, to achieve a high performance level, the ridesharing operator needs to make the matching decisions based on a global view of the system that includes all active riders and drivers. Consequently, the ride-matching problem that needs to be solved can become computationally expensive, especially when the system is operating over a large region, or when it faces high demand levels during certain hours of the day. This paper develops a graph partitioning methodology based on the bipartite graph that arises in the one-to-one ridematching problem. The proposed method decomposes the original graph into multiple subgraphs with the goal of reducing the overall computational complexity of the problem as well as providing high quality solutions. We further show that this methodology can be extended to more complex ride-matching problems in a dynamic ride-sharing system. Using numerical experiments, we showcase the advantages of the new partitioning method for different forms of ridematching problems. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the impact of different parameters on the quality of our solution.},

Further, ride-sharing allows sharing costs and, hence, reduces the congestion and emission by making better use of vehicle capacities. In this paper, we develop a distributed model-free, DeepPool, that uses deep Q-network (DQN) techniques to learn optimal dispatch policies by interacting with the environment. Further, DeepPool efﬁciently incorporates travel demand statistics and deep learning models to manage dispatching vehicles for improved ride sharing services. Using real-world dataset of taxi trip records in New York, DeepPool performs better than other strategies, proposed in the literature, that do not consider ride sharing or do not dispatch the vehicles to regions where the future demand is anticipated. Finally, DeepPool can adapt rapidly to dynamic environments since it is implemented in a distributed manner in which each vehicle solves its own DQN individually without coordination.},

	abstract = {On-demand ride-pooling (ODRP) services have the potential to improve traffic conditions in cities and at the same time offer user-centric mobility services. Recently, an analytical model, which investigates the influence of service quality parameters, such as detour, maximum waiting time, and boarding time, on the fraction of trips which could potentially be shared (a quantity called shareability), has been presented. The aim of this study is to test this model with a simulation framework that models an ODRP service in different levels of detail. The results show that by increasing the modeling complexity, in which we consider network topology, trip distribution patterns, optimization objectives, and changing velocity, the theoretical value of shareability and the actual experienced shared rides are decreased. It is observed that the shareability predicted by the mathematical model could be confirmed by a certain simulation setup with the objective to maximize shared rides. Nevertheless, changing the optimization objective to optimizing the total kilometers driven has the highest impact on shareability, decreasing it by up to 50\%. By using a fitting procedure within this simulation setup, we can still exploit the analytical model to predict the influence of service quality parameters. This study may be useful for other researchers who plan to model ridepooling systems and for operators who want to have an estimation of the level of shared rides they can achieve in an operating area.},

	abstract = {Transportation network companies (TNCs) are regularly demonstrating the economic and operational viability of dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) to any destination within a city (e.g., uberPOOL or Lyft Line), thanks to real-time information from smartphones. In the foreseeable future, ﬂeets of shared automated vehicles (SAVs) may largely eliminate the need for human drivers, while lowering per-mile operating costs and increasing the convenience of travel. This may dramatically reduce private vehicle ownership resulting in extensive use of SAVs. This study anticipates DRS matches across diﬀerent travelers and identiﬁes optimum ﬂeet sizes required using AirSage's cellphone-based trip tables across 1267 zones over 30 days. Assuming that the travel patterns do not change signiﬁcantly in the future, the results suggest signiﬁcant opportunities for DRS-enabled SAVs. Nearly 60\% of the single-person trips could be shared with other individuals traveling solo and with less than 5 min of added travel time (to arrive at their destinations), and this value climbs to 80\% for 15 to 30 min of added wait or travel time. 60,000 SAVs will be required to meet nearly 50\% of Orlando's 2.8 million single-traveler trips each day. With maximum ride-sharing delays of 15 minutes, and when focused on serving solo travelers, the average SAV is able to serve 25 person-trips per day, reducing parking demands while ﬁlling up passenger vehicle seats.},

In this paper, a multi-modal route choice model is proposed by incorporating ridesharing and public transit in a single-origin-destination (OD)-pair network. Due to the presence of ridesharing, travelers not only choose routes (including main road and side road), but also decide travel modes (including solo driver, ridesharing driver, ridesharing passenger, and transit passenger) to minimize travelers’ generalized travel cost (not their actual travel cost due to the existence of car capacity constraints). The proposed model is expressed as an equivalent complementarity problem. Finally, the impacts of key factors on ridesharing behavior in numerical examples are discussed. The equilibrium results show that passengers’ rewards and toll charge of solo drivers on main road signiﬁcantly affect the travelers’ route and mode choice behavior, and an increase of passengers’ rewards (toll) motivates (forces) more travelers to take environmentally friendly travel modes.},

	abstract = {With the rising fuel costs, ride sharing is becoming a common mode of transportation. Sharing taxis which has been prominent in several developing countries is also becoming common in several cities around the world. Sharing taxis presents several advantages as it minimizes vacant seats in cars thus reducing costs on taxi operators which results in signiﬁcantly lower taxi fares for passengers. Besides the economical advantages, taxi sharing is highly important for reducing congestion on the roads and for minimizing the impact of transportation on the environment. In this paper, we formulate the problem of assigning passengers to taxis and computing the optimal routes of taxis as a mixed integer program. To solve the proposed model, we present a Lagrangian decomposition approach which exploits the structure of the problem leading to smaller problems that are solved separately. Furthermore, we propose two heuristics that are used to obtain good quality feasible solutions. The Lagrangian approach along with the heuristics are implemented and compared to solving the full problem using CPLEX. The computational results indicate the efﬁciency of the methodology in providing tighter bounds than CPLEX in shorter computational time.},

The standard DARP objective is cost minimization. In addition to cost, the objectives considered in this paper include three terms related to quality of service. This gives rise to a multicriteria problem. The problem is solved by means of a ﬂexible and simple metaheuristic which efﬁciently integrates the reference point method for multicriteria optimization within a tabu search mechanism. Extensive tests were performed on randomly generated data and on real-life data provided by a major transporter in the Montreal area. Results indicate that the algorithm can yield a rich set of non-dominated solutions. It can also be employed to determine good trade-offs between cost and quality of service.},

With no human drivers, SATs urgently require precise traffic information in order to plan accurate paths independently; in addition, on-time arrival is an essential service quality in SAT systems. In this study, taxis are assumed to be replaced with ride-sharing autonomous vehicles. To improve the probability of on-time arrival, the reliable path concept and collected travel time information are used to facilitate path finding for SATs, and the potential benefits are examined. Two simulation scenarios—one based on historical traffic information and the other based on real-time traffic information—are executed to evaluate the information’s usefulness in reliable path finding. In simulation results, reliable path scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than shortest path scenarios, in which the shortest path algorithm is used in path finding for SATs, and the historical information-based scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than the real-time information-based scenarios. A system-beneficial path finding method is proposed and is verified to be effective for mitigating road network congestion.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with a combinatorial optimization problem that models situations of both dynamic ride-sharing and taxi-sharing. Passengers who want to share a taxi or a ride, use an app to specify their current location, destination and further information such as the earliest departure time, the latest arrival time and the maximum cost they are willing to pay for the ride. Car owners also specify their origin, destination, the leaving time and the maximum accepted delay. Taxi drivers report their location and the time they will start and end the service. All drivers need to deﬁne a price per kilometer. The problem is to compute routes, matching requests to vehicles in such a way that ride-sharing is allowed as long as some restrictions are satisﬁed, such as: the capacity of the vehicle, maximum trip cost of each passenger and maximum delay. The problem is dynamic since new requests arrive on-line and routes can be modiﬁed in order to attend them. To solve this dynamic problem, the day is divided in time periods. For each period, an instance of a static problem is created and solved by a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Experiments with instances based on real data were made to evaluate the heuristics and the proposed method. In our simulations with taxis, passengers paid, on average, almost 30\% less than they would pay on private rides.},

	abstract = {Dial-a-ride problems are concerned with the design of efﬁcient vehicle routes for transporting individual persons from speciﬁc origin to speciﬁc destination locations. In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous ﬂeet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current stateof-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

	abstract = {Demand Responsive Transportation (DRT) is currently growing in our cities as shared ride-hailing services operated by private companies, providing a hybrid service between the bus and the taxi. Like DRT, these new ondemand services could be used to feed and complement the public transport, and additionally, their flexibility might bring other market opportunities, beneficial to cities and metropolitan areas. However, the true potential of them, as well as the recognition of the service requirements depending on the type of user and use case, remains unstudied. Hence, the aim of this research is to identify user requirements and market opportunities, from the case study conducted with the participation of 1211 users of the MOIA service test in Hanover, to contribute to the successful design of this new generation of DRT. Results indicate a high interest in using MOIA for leisure trips, identify the highest intention of use of the service within suburban areas, and recognise a different behaviour, both in the intention of use and for user requirements, depending on the age of the users and the usage frequency.},

To assess the merits of our methods we present a simulation study based on 2008 travel demand data from metropolitan Atlanta. The simulation results indicate that the use of sophisticated optimization methods instead of simple greedy matching rules substantially improve the performance of ride-sharing systems. Furthermore, even with relatively low participation rates, it appears that sustainable populations of dynamic ride-sharing participants may be possible even in relatively sprawling urban areas with many employment centers.},

	abstract = {It is estimated that 76\% of commuters are driving to work alone while each of them experiences a 38-h delay annually due to trafﬁc congestion. Ridesharing is an efﬁcient way to utilize the unused capacity and help with congestion reduction, and it has recently become more and more popular due to new communication technologies. Understanding the complex relations between ridesharing and trafﬁc congestion is a critical step in the evaluation of a ridesharing enterprise or of the effectiveness of regulatory policies or incentives to promote ridesharing. The objective of this paper is to introduce a mathematical framework for the study of the ridesharing impacts on trafﬁc congestion and to pave the way for the analysis of how people can be motivated to participate in ridesharing, and conversely, how congestion inﬂuences ridesharing activities. We accomplish this objective by developing a new trafﬁc equilibrium model with ridesharing, and formulating the model as a mixed complementarity problem (MiCP). We provide conditions on the model parameters under which there exists one and only one solution to this model. The computational results show that when the congestion cost decreases or the ridesharing inconvenience cost increases, more travelers would become solo drivers and thus less people would participate in ridesharing. On the other hand, when the ridesharing price increases, more travelers would become ridesharing drivers.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the dial-a-ride problem of ride-sharing automated taxis (ATs) in an urban road network, considering the traffic congestion caused by the ATs. This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies (TNC) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming (INLP) model that optimizes the routing of the ATs to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the ATs’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of ATs circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the AT system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the AT system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the potential effects of automated driving that are relevant to policy and society are explored, findings discussed in literature about those effects are reviewed and areas for future research are identified. The structure of our review is based on the ripple effect concept, which represents the implications of automated vehicles at three different stages: first-order (traffic, travel cost, and travel choices), second-order (vehicle ownership and sharing, location choices and land use, and transport infrastructure), and third-order (energy consumption, air pollution, safety, social equity, economy, and public health). Our review shows that first-order impacts on road capacity, fuel efficiency, emissions, and accidents risk are expected to be beneficial. The magnitude of these benefits will likely increase with the level of automation and cooperation and with the penetration rate of these systems. The synergistic effects between vehicle automation, sharing, and electrification can multiply these benefits. However, studies confirm that automated vehicles can induce additional travel demand because of more and longer vehicle trips. Potential land use changes have not been included in these estimations about excessive travel demand. Other third-order benefits on safety, economy, public health and social equity still remain unclear. Therefore, the balance between the short-term benefits and long-term impacts of vehicle automation remains an open question.},

	abstract = {City logistics is a discipline specialized to cope with the sustainability problems encountered in urban freight transport. A key characteristic of it is the heterogeneity of the stakeholders involved. Besides the traditional logistics actors such as shippers, carriers and receivers that share consistent interests (i.e. price and quality), city logistics highly respect the interests of public administrators and citizens that care more about the social welfare. To reach an optimal balance between private and public beneﬁt, it is necessary to understand and in turn forecast the behavior pattern of different groups. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been practiced as an unconventional tool to fulﬁll this task for its strong capability on capturing the dynamic behavior of individual stakeholders and their interconnections. Referring to other domains (e.g. energy system) where the application of agent-based modeling is relatively mature, a following urgency is to achieve interoperability and in turn reusability between models via introducing formal ontology as a shared template with which developers can standardize their models. This paper introduces an initiative of developing an ontology that formalizes the domain knowledge of city logistics.},

	abstract = {We develop an early warning system and subsequent optimal intervention policy to avoid the formation of disproportional dominance (“winner takes all,” WTA) in growing complex networks. This is modeled as a system of interacting agents, whereby the rate at which an agent establishes connections to others is proportional to its already existing number of connections and its intrinsic fitness. We derive an exact four-dimensional phase diagram that separates the growing system into two regimes: one where the “fit get richer” and one where, eventually, the WTA. By calibrating the system’s parameters with maximum likelihood, its distance from the unfavorable WTA regime can be monitored in real time. This is demonstrated by applying the theory to the eToro social trading platform where users mimic each other’s trades. If the system state is within or close to the WTA regime, we show how to efficiently control the system back into a more stable state along a geodesic path in the space of fitness distributions. It turns out that the common measure of penalizing the most dominant agents does not solve sustainably the problem of drastic inequity. Instead, interventions that first create a critical mass of high-fitness individuals followed by pushing the relatively low-fitness individuals upward is the best way to avoid swelling inequity and escalating fragility.},

	title = {Open access transport models: {A} leverage point in sustainable transport planning},
	abstract = {A large and growing body of evidence suggests fundamental changes are needed in transport systems, to tackle issues such as air pollution, physical inactivity and climate change. Transport models can play a major role in tackling these issues through the transport planning process, but they have historically been focussed on motorised modes (especially cars) and available only to professional transport planners working within the existing paradigm. Building on the principles of open access software, first developed in the context of geographic information systems, this paper develops and discusses the concept of open access transport models, which we define as models that are both developed using open source software and are available to be used by the public without the need for specialist training or the purchase of software licences. We explore the future potential of open access transport models to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector. We do this with reference to the literature on the use of tools in the planning process, and by exploring an example that is already in use: the ‘Propensity to Cycle Tool’. We conclude that open access transport models can be a leverage point in the planning process due to their ability to provide robust, transparent and actionable evidence that is available to a range of stakeholders, not just professional transport planners. Open access transport models represent a disruptive technology deserving further research and development, by planners, researchers and citizen scientists, including open source software developers and advocacy groups but, in order to fulfil their potential, they will require both financial and policy support from government bodies.},

This paper argues that it is essential to understand why people travel the way they do and not only be able to predict the overall activity patterns accurately. If one cannot understand the ‘‘why?’’ then a model’s ability to evaluate the impact of future interventions is severely diminished. Bayesian networks (BNs) provide the ability to investigate causality and is showing value in recent literature to generate synthetic populations. This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately. It outperforms a frequentist approach and can cater for infrequently observed activity patterns, and patterns unobserved in small sample data. It can also account for temporal variables like activity duration.},

	abstract = {Population synthesis is concerned with the generation of agents for agent-based modelling in many fields, such as economics, transportation, ecology and epidemiology. When the number of attributes describing the agents and/or their level of detail becomes large, survey data cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. It leads to a situation where many attribute combinations are missing from the sample data while such combinations exist in the real population. In this case, it becomes essential to consider methods that are able to impute such missing information effectively. In this paper, we propose to use deep generative latent models. These models are able to learn a com­ pressed representation of the data space, which when projected back to the original space, leads to an effective way of imputing information in the observed data space. Specifically, we employ the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are applied to a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables and trained and tested using crossvalidation. A new metric that applies to the evaluation of generative models in an unsuper­ vised setting is proposed. It is based on the ability to generate diverse yet valid synthetic attribute combinations by comparing if the models can recover missing combinations (sampling zeros) while keeping truly impossible combinations (structural zeros) models at a minimum. For a lowdimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5\%, 21\% and 26\% more structural zeros per sampling zero when compared to the WGAN. For a high dimensional case, these figures increase to 44\%, 2217\% and 170440\% respectively. This research directly supports the development of agent-based systems and in particular cases where detailed socio-economic or geographical representations are required.},

	abstract = {Micro-simulation travel demand and land use models require a synthetic population, which consists of a set of agents characterized by demographic and socio-economic attributes. Two main families of population synthesis techniques can be distinguished: (a) ﬁtting methods (iterative proportional ﬁtting, updating) and (b) combinatorial optimization methods. During the last few years, a third outperforming family of population synthesis procedures has emerged, i.e., Markov process-based methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations. In this paper, an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach is presented, which can serve as a better alternative than the existing methods. The approach is characterized by a great ﬂexibility and eﬃciency in terms of data preparation and model training. The HMM is able to reproduce the structural conﬁguration of a given population from an unlimited number of micro-samples and a marginal distribution. Only one marginal distribution of the considered population can be used as a boundary condition to “guide” the synthesis of the whole population. Model training and testing are performed using the Survey on the Workforce of 2013 and the Belgian National Household Travel Survey of 2010. Results indicate that the HMM method captures the complete heterogeneity of the micro-data contrary to standard ﬁtting approaches. The method provides accurate results as it is able to reproduce the marginal distributions and their corresponding multivariate joint distributions with an acceptable error rate (i.e., SRSME=0.54 for 6 synthesized attributes). Furthermore, the HMM outperforms IPF for small sample sizes, even though the amount of input data is less than that for IPF. Finally, simulations show that the HMM can merge information provided by multiple data sources to allow good population estimates.},

The population synthesis method is capable of building the joint distribution of a given population with its corresponding marginal distributions using either full or partial conditional probabilities or both of them simultaneously. In particular, the estimation of socio-demographic or transport-related variables and the characterization of daily activity-travel patterns are included within the framework. The fully probabilistic structure based on Markov Chains characterizing this framework makes it innovative compared to standard activity-based models. Moreover, data stemming from the 2010 Belgian Household Daily Travel Survey (BELDAM) are used to calibrate the modeling framework. We illustrate that this framework effectively captures the behavioral heterogeneity of travelers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is adequately adapted to meeting the demand for large-scale micro-simulation scenarios of transportation and urban systems.},

We analyze two population synthesis methods for diﬀerent levels of scalability, i.e. two to ﬁve attributes and diﬀerent sample sizes – 10\%, 25\% and 50\%. Results reveal that the simulation-based approach is more stable than Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) when the number of attributes increases. However, IPF is less sensitive to changes in sample size when compared to the simulation-based approach. We also demonstrate the importance of choosing the appropriate metric to validate the synthetic populations as the trends in terms of RMSE/MAE are diﬀerent from those of SRMSE.},

As activity-travel behavior of people depends particularly on socio-demographics and transport/urban-related variables, there is an increasing need for advanced methods to merge information provided by multiple urban/transport household surveys. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and an Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to obtain quasi-perfect marginal distributions and accurate multi-variate joint distributions. The model allows for the combination of an unlimited number of datasets. The model is validated on the basis of a synthetic dataset with 1,000,000 observations and 8 categorical variables. The results reveal that the hierarchical model is particularly robust as the deviation between the simulated and observed multivariate joint distributions is extremely small and constant, regardless of the sampling rates and the composition of the datasets in terms of variables included in those datasets. Besides, the presented methodological framework allows for an intelligent merging of multiple data sources. Furthermore, heterogeneity is smoothly incorporated into micro-samples with small sampling rates subjected to potential sampling bias. These aspects are handled simultaneously to build a generalized probabilistic structure from which new observations can be inferred. A major impact in term of expert systems is that the outputs of the hierarchical model (HM) model serve as a basis for a qualitative and quantitative analyses of integrated datasets.},

A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution, encoding probabilistic relationships among a set of variables in an efﬁcient way. Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efﬁcient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and conﬁdentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overﬁtting of data can be avoided as much as possible.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a population synthesiser based on the method of Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) algorithm developed for the new Danish national transport model system. The synthesiser is designed for large population matrices and allows target variables to be represented in several target constraints. As a result, constraints for the IPF are cross-linked, which makes it difﬁcult to ensure consistency of targets in a forecast perspective. The paper proposes a new solution strategy to ensure internal consistency of the population targets in order to guarantee proper convergence of the IPF algorithm. The solution strategy consists in establishing a harmonisation process for the population targets, which combined with a linear programming approach, is applied to generate a consistent target representation. The model approach is implemented and tested on Danish administrative register data. A test on historical census data shows that a 2006 population could be predicted by a 1994 population with an overall percentage deviation of 5–6\% given that targets were known. It is also indicated that the deviation is approximately a linear function of the length of the forecast period.},

In the course of the optimization process, possible alternatives are searched using a modified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Window. The method is extended with a genetic algorithm to provide an optimal order of activities as the minimum of the predefined cost function (i.e. travel time). The multiobjective optimization can efficiently mitigate the travel time of the users. In order to provide some insight regarding the performance of the optimization algorithm, application-oriented simulations were performed on a real-world transportation network using real travel time information. Three transportation modes were considered: car, public transport, and combined (public transport with car-sharing). The simulation results demonstrate that the optimization is able to reduce travel time by 20–30\%.},

They describe travel itineraries of individual travelers, namely, what activities they are participating in, when they perform these activities, and how they choose to travel to the activity locales. However, data collection for activitybased models is performed through travel surveys that are infrequent, expensive, and reﬂect the changes in transportation with signiﬁcant delays. Thanks to the ubiquitous cell phone data, we see an opportunity to substantially complement these surveys with data extracted from network carrier mobile phone usage logs, such as call detail records (CDRs). In this paper, we develop input–output hidden Markov models to infer travelers’ activity patterns from CDRs. We apply the model to the data collected by a major network carrier serving millions of users in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our approach delivers an end-to-end actionable solution to the practitioners in the form of a modular and interpretable activity-based travel demand model. It is experimentally validated with three independent data sources: aggregated statistics from travel surveys, a set of collected ground truth activities, and the results of a trafﬁc micro-simulation informed with the travel plans synthesized from the developed generative model.},

Some activities are not necessarily fixed temporally and spatially, therefore they can be realized in different times or locations. By using flexible demand points, the method is capable of finding new combinations of activity chains and choosing the optimal set of activities. The optimization algorithm solves the TSP-TW (Traveling Salesman Problem – Time Window) problem with many flexible demand points, which resulted in high complexity and long processing times. Therefore, two extensions were developed to speed up the processes. A POI (Point Of Interest) search algorithm enabled to search demand points in advance and store them in an offline database. Furthermore GA (genetic algorithm) was applied and customized to realize lower optimization times. During the implementation, three different transportation modes were defined: car, public transport, and combined (public transport with car-sharing opportunity). The simulations were performed on arbitrarily chosen test networks using Matlab. Promising test results were obtained for all transportation modes with total travel time reduction of 10–15 percent. The application of the extended optimization method produced shorter activity chains and decreased total travel time for the users.},

An approach has been developed based on activity-based modeling and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework to calculate a suitable schedule of activities, taking into account the locations of activities, modes of transport, and the time of attendance to each activity. The priorities of the travelers concerning the spatial and temporal ﬂexibility were considered, as well as the constraints that are related to the limited range of the EVs, the availability of Charging Stations (CS), and the elevation of the road network. In order to model real travel behavior, two charging scenarios were realized. In the ﬁrst case, the traveler stays in the EV at the CS, and in the second case, the traveler leaves the EV to charge at the CS while conducting another activity at a nearby location. Through a series of tests on synthetic activity chain data, we proved the suitability of the method elaborated for addressing the needs of travelers and being utilized as an optimization method for a modern Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).},

It is estimated with data from the Portland, Oregon 1994 Activity and Travel Survey. Results show that the basic model, which has 10 endogenous time use and trip generation variables and 13 exogenous variables, ®ts well, and all postulated relationships are upheld. Test show that the basic model, which divides activities into work and nonwork, can be extended to a three-way breakdown of subsistence, discretionary and obligatory activities. The model can also capture the eects of in-home work on trip chaining and activity participation.

	abstract = {A robust body of research in transportation has brought to light valuable ﬁndings and supported the development of important tools. However, crucial questions of “undone” science remain –topics and methods that current research practices could partially overlook. This review essay argues that transportation research could beneﬁt from more critical reﬂection on researchers’ positionalities, the ﬁeld’s emphasis on some methods and topics rather than others, and the role of funding. The article ﬁrst considers the questions of funding inﬂuence and researcher positionality in the broader social sciences literature and then the implications of funding and positionality in transportation research. In the United States, transportation funding generally emphasises engineering ﬁelds and applied solutions; historically underrepresented racial/ethnic groups are a small share of researchers. Because of disciplinary traditions, funding, positionality, and other factors, transportation research paradigms may give relatively less attention to social issues, qualitative data, and local knowledge, while emphasising quantitative data, modelling, physical factors, and infrastructure building. The purpose of this paper is to start a dialogue, using the social science literatures, information about the transportation ﬁeld, and examples of the importance of social and qualitative methods. Collective dialogue about researchers’ positionalities and demographics, diﬀerent types of knowledge, and the ﬁeld could uncover important areas and approaches for transportation research and practice.},

While previous research has emphasized speciﬁc features and qualities of AVs, little is known about how attitudinal factors shape AV acceptance across a range of AV ‘‘modes” from privately-owned AVs to AV taxis shared with strangers. With an online panel of 834 US-based participants, we examine attitudes towards AVs and sharing. An exploratory factor analysis establishes four attitudinal dimensions: technology acceptance, risk-taking, trafﬁc regulation, and driving enjoyment. We estimate multinomial logistic regression models to examine the impact of these four factors on attitudes toward AVs, willingness to purchase AVs, willingness to use AVs as a taxi service, and willingness to share AV taxis with strangers. We ﬁnd a complex relationship between psychological factors and AV attitudes. ‘‘Early adopters” of technology and those who support stricter trafﬁc regulations are more likely to have a positive attitude about AVs, whereas those who avoid risky behavior were more likely to have a negative attitude instead of a neutral attitude. Similar patterns were found across models of purchasing, using, and sharing AVs. The results imply that people who support trafﬁc regulations may perceive AVs as a safer transport mode than human-driven cars, while those who avoid risk-taking behavior may perceive AVs to be more dangerous. However, we ﬁnd that a large fraction of the population is not yet ready to use an AV with no driver, and overall reluctance to share a ride in an AV taxi.},

	abstract = {Urban planners, authorities, and numerous additional players have to deal with challenges related to the rapid urbanization process and its effect on human mobility and transport dynamics. Hence, optimize transportation systems represents a unique occasion for municipalities. Indeed, the quality of transport is linked to economic growth, and by decreasing trafﬁc congestion, the life quality of the inhabitants is drastically enhanced. Most state-of-the-art solutions optimize trafﬁc in speciﬁc and small zones of cities (e.g., single intersections) and cannot be used to gather insights for an entire city. Moreover, evaluating such optimized policies in a realistic way that is convincing for policy-makers can be extremely expensive. In our work, we propose a reinforcement learning frameworks to overtake these two limitations. In particular, we use human mobility data to optimize the transport dynamics of three real-world cities (i.e., Berlin, Santiago de Chile, Dakar) and a synthesized one (i.e., SynthTown). To this end, we transform the transportation dynamics’ simulator MATSim into a realistic reinforcement learning environment able to optimize and evaluate transportation policies using agents that perform realistic daily activities and trips. In this way, we can assess transportation policies in a manner that is convincing for policy-makers. Finally, we develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates MATSim dynamics with a Partially Observable Discrete Event Decision Process (PODEDP) and, with respect to other state-of-art policy optimization techniques, can scale on big transportation data and ﬁnd optimal policies also on a city-scale.},

Activity-based models are valuable tools for transportation planning and analysis, detailing the tour and mode-restricted nature of the household and individual travel choices. Nevertheless, no single approach has emerged as a dominant method, and research continues to improve ABM features to make them more accurate, robust, and practical. This paper describes the state of art and practice, including the ongoing ABM research covering both demand and supply considerations. Despite the substantial developments, ABM’s abilities in reflecting behavioral realism are still limited. Possible solutions to address this issue include increasing the inaccuracy of the primary data, improved integrity of ABMs across days of the week, and tackling the uncertainty via integrating demand and supply. Opportunities exist to test, the feasibility of spatial transferability of ABMs to new geographical contexts along with expanding the applicability of ABMs in transportation policy-making.},

	abstract = {To reduce inaccuracies due to insufficient spatial resolution of models, it has been suggested to use smaller raster cells instead of larger zones. Increasing the number of zones, however, increases the size of a matrix to store travel times, called skim tables in transport modeling. Those become difficult to create, to store and to read, while most of the origin-destination pairs are calculated and stored but never used. At the same time, such approaches do not solve inaccuracies due to lack of temporal resolution. This paper analyzes the use of personalized travel times at the finest spatial resolution possible (at x/y coordinates) and a detailed temporal resolution for synthetic agents. The approach is tested in the context of an existing integrated land use/transport model (ILUT) where travel times affect, among others, household relocation decisions. In this paper, person-level individual travel times are compared to traditional skim-based travel times to identify the extent of errors caused by spatial and temporal aggregation and how they affect relocation decisions in the model. It was shown that skim-based travel times fail to capture the spatial and temporal variations of travel times available at a microscopic scale of an agent-based ILUT model. Skims may provide acceptable averages for car travel times if a dense network and small zones are used. Transit travel times, however, suffer from temporal and spatial aggregation of skims. When analyzing travel-time-dependent relocation decisions in the land use model, transit captive households tend to react more sensitively to the transit level of service when individual travel times are used. The findings add to the existing literature a quantification of spatial biases in ILUT models and present a novel approach to overcome them. The presented methodology eliminates the impact of the chosen zone system on model results, and thereby, avoids biases caused by the modifiable spatial unit problem.},

We investigate the fleet size required when taking either the perspective of Transit Planning Authority (Agency) or Service Provider (Operator).

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the way people are transported. While driverless technology may mean fewer vehicles are required to transport people to and from their daily activities, such changes may result in increased congestion or total miles traveled. In this study, we solve the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem to identify cost-optimal routings of vehicles throughout the day. Such a tool will be useful for consumers seeking to minimize cost and for regulators seeking to understand and predict how people may behave in different scenarios. We provide a thorough literature review and construct a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the daily travel cost of a household attending a given set of activities. Since solution time is a determinant for applicability of such a model, we present the model in a component-wise fashion. This approach allows us to understand which features most affect the problem complexity and solution time. We note that modeling carpooling is the feature that most increases time to ﬁnd an optimal solution, and we therefore propose a novel modeling technique for carpooling two people. We illustrate the performance of our model by comparing it with other models from the literature and note that our model can solve signiﬁcantly larger problem instances and in a time that is short enough to facilitate real-time scheduling. We also highlight the utility of our model for regulators, who can use it to analyze quickly produced optimal routes under different cost/tax scenarios.},

	abstract = {We introduce a multi-agent-based simulation methodology to investigate the feasibility and evaluate environmental and economic sustainability of an electrified urban waste collection. Electrification is a potential solution for transport decarbonization and already widely available for individual and public transport. However, the availability of electrified commercial vehicles like waste collection vehicles is still limited, despite their significant contribution to urban emissions. Moreover, there is a lack of clarity whether electric waste collection vehicles can persist in real word conditions and which system design is required. Therefore, we present a synthetic model for waste collection demand on a perlink basis, using open available data. The tour planning is solved by an opensource algorithm as a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This generates plausible tours which handle the demand. The generated tours are simulated with an open-source transport simulation (MATSim) for both the diesel and the electric waste collection vehicles. To compare the life cycle costs, we analyze the data using total cost of ownership (TCO). Environmental impacts are evaluated based on a Well-to-Wheel approach. We present a comparison of the two propulsion types for the exemplary use case of Berlin. And we are able to generate a suitable planning to handle Berlin’s waste collection demand using battery electric vehicles only. The TCO calculation reveals that the electrification raises the total operator cost by 16-30 \%, depending on the scenario and the battery size with conservative assumptions. Furthermore, the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) can be reduced by 60-99\%, depending on the carbon footprint of electric power generation.},

To address this issue, we propose a framework designed only with user-aggregated mobile phone data to synthesise realistic daily individual mobility — Digital Twin Travellers. We explore diﬀerent strategies built around modiﬁed Markov models and an adaption of the Rejection Sampling algorithm to recreate realistic daily schedules and locations. We also deﬁne a one-day mobility population score to measure the similarity between the population of generated agents and the real mobile phone user population.

	abstract = {This paper investigates how and to what extent changes in user behavior may mitigate the environmental benefits of urban ridesharing, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “rebound effect”. Ridesharing reduces both the individual cost of car travel (through cost splitting) and road travel times (by decreasing congestion). This may trigger a number of behavioral changes among transportation users, including: making less detours to avoid congestion (route choice effect), switching from public transit and active modes to the car (modal shift effect), travelling longer distances (distance effect), and relocating further from the urban center (relocation effect). Taking Paris region as a case study, this research applies an integrated transportation/land-use model to evaluate several ridesharing scenarios and quantify the four rebound effects. The overall rebound effect is found to be substantial, cancelling out from 68 to 77\% of CO2 emission reductions and from 52 to 73\% of aggregated social benefits (including congestion, air quality, CO2 emissions, noise) expected from ridesharing. This is primarily the result of the modal shift effect, supplemented as ridesharing develops by the distance effect. Although the simplified representation of ridesharing in the baseline model calls for caution regarding these estimates, a sensitivity analysis corroborates the main findings and the prevalence of substantial rebound effects. The paper also investigates to what extent three complementary policies - improving public transit, reducing road capacity or increasing the cost of car travel – might limit the overall rebound effect and thereby maximize the benefits of urban ridesharing.},

We ﬁnd that while urban road freight represents only 6\% of trips and 8\% of distances traveled by road in the Paris region, it accounts for 36\% of total damages caused by pollutant emissions from road traﬃc. This is the combined result of light and heavy goods vehicles emitting more than private cars, and of freight traﬃc being more spatially concentrated (within the city center) than passenger traﬃc, thereby aﬀecting more population. All in all, the environmental cost of urban road freight is around 2.1 billion € per year. Some policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the environmental beneﬁts of ride-sharing through its CO2 emission mitigation potential. Ride-sharing is expected to substantially decrease CO2 emissions by raising vehicle occupancy, thus mechanically reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Yet, as ride-sharing entails both a decrease in travel (monetary) costs and in travel times (inasmuch as it reduces road congestion), it is likely to make the car more attractive ultimately. This could result in mode switching in the short run (as travelers forsake public transport or active modes for car), as well as in longer distances travelled in the medium run. In the long run, people could even take advantage of the easier travel conditions to relocate further within the metropolitan area. To account for these rebound effects, we develop an integrated land-use transport model. This intends to capture the effects of ride-sharing on the whole household decision process regarding transport and residential location. The model is applied to the Paris region, with several ride-sharing scenarios for year 2030. While ride-sharing does indeed strongly reduce CO2 emissions, we ﬁnd substantial rebound mechanisms. In contrast to the (naïve) expectation that raising vehicle occupancy by 50\% would reduce CO2 emissions by 33\%, the various rebound effects end up dividing the CO2 emission savings by a factor ranging from 2 to 3 depending on the day period considered (i.e. the morning or evening peak period). The rebound mechanisms - the mode switching, distance and relocation effects - should therefore be heeded. Some policy recommendations are provided to develop ride-sharing while curbing these unintended effects.},

In this context, there is increasing use of numerical modeling techniques addressing the design, selection and/or calibration of policy instruments. The question of the relations between appraisal tools and policymaking has been widely studied. However, few studies have specifically focused on the role of modeling in policymaking processes. Drawing on two case studies, this paper suggests a change in the nature of multi-expertise: neither conflicting nor cross-sectoral, we observed in both cases an interwoven configuration with a network of experts making use of integrated models. We call this configuration distributed expertise, arguing that it is a novel configuration and that its emergence is closely linked to the development of integrated modeling techniques. Other authors have discussed the idea that the growing need for new appraisal tools is linked with the proliferation of wicked policy problems. From our case studies we would conclude that the emergence of integrated modeling is not a response to complex problems but to complex systems of actors who need to reach a consensus on actions.},

Notably, companies like Uber or Lyft have successfully applied the classical dial-a-ride method, in which users are assigned to vehicles in such a way as to minimise the cost function under a set of constraints. In this paper, we construct an agentbased model based on vehicles where demand is assigned through aggregation by origin–destination pair. Two operating strategies are described: in the first, the pickup strategy is applied at vehicle level, in the second it is applied at global service level, with vehicles being shared dynamically and making extra stops to collect travellers with different destinations. At each iteration time, the set of possible options depending on itinerary and demand are tested first for already assigned vehicles then for free vehicles. The option associated with the maximum utility is selected to set the vehicle or service strategy. A case study illustrates a comparison between both strategies and evaluates the efficiency of several service choices. A service where vehicles are managed by a dispatcher is more efficient for both users and operator.},

It proposes a detailed analysis of inequalities and interactions in dual-earner families when it comes to escorting children by taking into account the characteristics of trips to and from school for children, the characteristics of the parents’ occupations, and the characteristics of the household. Compared with earlier research, the model considers more detailed data about the escorts’ jobs, such as speciﬁc working hours, which provide a better understanding of the constraints on parents and insight into the choices made when both parents are in a position to escort their children. The ﬁndings depart somewhat from those of earlier work on the question because more speciﬁc data are considered. They show a marked gender inequality in escorting because mothers in dual-earner families do more than two-thirds of the escorting. But the factors explaining the sharing of escorting act almost symmetrically for both parents, with the effect of work starting and ﬁnishing times being preponderant. These models conﬁrm that the inequality kicks in ahead of this: mothers in dual-earner households are more often than fathers in jobs with short working hours and which are more compatible with escorting.},

The article raises the question of how they adapt their mobility practices to a daily life without a private car. The article hypothesizes differences between motorized, demotorized and car-free households that have never owned a car, depending on whether demotorization is more constrained or chosen, and finally on the age of demotorization, which may favor specific forms of reorganization of lifestyles. The answers come from the statistical analysis of two major national surveys, the ENTD (2008) and the Vehicle Fleet Panel (2015).

	abstract = {Limiting commuting trips in major cities is important from the environmental, social and economic standpoints. In order to design policies that aim to change commuting practices it is, however, necessary to have acquired a good understanding of the trips in question and their determinants. However, these trips have been subjected to very little study in the cities of developing countries. This paper is concerned with the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area (RJMA), and sets out to test the inﬂuence of “classical” socioeconomic and spatial variables on the distance and duration of the commuting trips of the region's inhabitants, especially those with the lowest incomes. The main original feature of this research is that it includes jobs in the informal sector. The results show that, all other things being equal, commuting distances and times are shorter for the informal sector, and people walk more from their homes to their place of work because jobs in the informal sector are more dispersed than jobs in the formal sectors. The notable exception is personal and household services for which employees (who are mainly women) live a long way from the city center where wealthy families (and their jobs) are concentrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models represent fundamental tools to forecast traffic flows on road networks, assessing the effects of traffic management and transport policies. As biased models lead to incorrect predictions, which can cause inaccurate evaluations and huge social costs, the calibration of DTA models is an established and active research field. When it comes to estimating Origin-Destination (OD) demand flows, perhaps the most important input for DTA models, one algorithm suggested to outperform all the others for real-time applications: the Kalman Filter (KF). This paper introduces a non-linear Kalman Filter framework for online dynamic OD estimation that reduces the number of variables and can easily incorporate heterogeneous data sources to better explain the non-linear relationship between traffic data and time-dependent OD-flows. Specifically, we propose a model that takes advantage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture spatial correlations between variables and better exploit the local nature of a specific KF recently proposed in literature, the Local Ensemble Transformed Kalman filter (LETKF). The main advantage of the LETKF is that the Kalman gain is not explicitly formulated which means that, differently from other approaches proposed in the literature, there is no need to compute the assignment matrix or its approximation. The paper shows that the LETKF can easily incorporate different data sources, such as traffic counts and link speeds. Additionally, thanks to the PCA, the model can identify local patterns within the data and better explain the correlation between variables and data. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated first through synthetic experiments where non-linear functions are used to benchmark the model in different conditions and then on the real-world network of Vitoria, Spain (2,884 nodes, 5,799 links) using the mesoscopic simulator Aimsun. Results show that the proposed method leads to better state estimation performances with respect to other Ensemble-based Kalman filters, providing improvements as high as 64\% in terms of traffic data reproduction with a 17-fold problem dimensionality reduction.},

However, the market of singleand two-family houses is characterized by low return rates for excess power injected to the grid, and the installation of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) is sensitive to ﬁnancial incentives. We assess the drivers inﬂuencing the diﬀusion of rooftop solar PV systems until 2050, by employing an agent-based model. An agent is a single- or two-family house, and its decision to invest depends on the economic proﬁtability of the investment, the agent’s income, environmental beneﬁts (injunctive social norm), awareness and knowledge about the solar PV technology, and the impact of the social network (descriptive social norm). The model includes a synthetic population of agents, statistically equivalent to the true population. We also investigate the impact of diﬀerent support policies, technology learning rates, electricity prices, and discount rates on the investment decision. We ﬁnd that the concept of prosumer emerges, mainly via self-consumption strategies. The diﬀusion process of rooftop solar PV systems in single- and two-family houses gains momentum in the future. In the near-term, PV deployment is sensitive to the proﬁtability of the investment, while after the year 2030, peer eﬀects play an increasing role in the agents’ investment decisions.},

The efﬁcient management of ﬂeets of vehicles remains a key challenge, in particular to achieve a demand-aligned distribution of available vehicles, commonly referred to as rebalancing. In this article, we present a discrete-time model of an autonomous MoD system, in which unit capacity self-driving vehicles serve transportation requests consisting of a (time, origin, destination) tuple on a directed graph. Time delays in the discrete-time model are approximated as ﬁrst-order lag elements yielding a sparse model suitable for model predictive control (MPC). The well-posedness of the model is demonstrated, and a characterization of its equilibrium points is given. Furthermore, we show the stabilizability of the model and propose an MPC scheme that, due to the sparsity of the model, can be applied even to large-scale cities. We verify the performance of the scheme in a multiagent transport simulation and demonstrate that service levels outperform those of the existing rebalancing schemes for identical ﬂeet sizes.},

Existing formulations model mobility-on-demand systems in a queuing theoretical, network flow-based, or continuous, kinematic framework. In this work, we model a mobility-on-demand system as a stochastic differential equation that represents a generalization of previous approaches. Based on the model, we define system imbalance as the difference of the stochastic processes of service request arrival and vehicle arrival. We formally derive the first moment of the system imbalance for an imbalance control strategy that consists of a feedforward control approach (reference trajectory) and an additional feedback component. A distributed feedback control policy is defined that averages the imbalance across the system and therefore aims at a uniform quality of service distribution. Finally, we verify our results in a high-fidelity and large-scale agent-based simulation of a hypothetical mobility-on-demand system.},

	abstract = {In a one-way mobility-on-demand system or distributed transportation system, customer requests for rides are served by a ﬂeet of agents, e.g., taxis or even autonomous vehicles. We present a simpliﬁed three-node network model of such a transportation system in an urban agglomeration. The agents in this model play a non-cooperative game as each one tries to maximize their individual expected proﬁt. We compute Nash equilibria in this game for different customer load cases, speciﬁcally the light- and heavy-load cases, and compare the social cost of a system with selﬁsh agents to that of a system with coordinated agents. In particular, we establish a lower bound for the price of anarchy as a function of the system parameters, including taxi fares. We investigate the required mechanism design in the form of the fare ratio for a downtown core node and a city outskirts node that minimizes the social cost caused by selﬁsh agents. Furthermore, we show that this optimal fare ratio is required to bring the social cost for the selﬁsh agents as close as possible to that of the coordinated ﬂeet. The chosen level of abstraction for the network with only three nodes is not intended to accomplish completeness; rather, it provides elementary insights into why mobility-on-demand systems with selﬁsh agents in many cities operate at a sub-optimal level of performance. This paper motivates the investigation of the value of coordination in more complex systems, as well as the study and implementation of coordinated one-way mobility-on-demand transportation systems.},

Results suggest the average SAV in this region can serve at most 30 person-trips per day with less than 5 min average wait time, but generates 13\% more vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). With dynamic ride-sharing (DRS), SAV VMT fell, on average, by 17\% and empty VMT (eVMT) fell by 26\%. Compared to idling-at-curb scenarios, parkingrestricted scenarios generated 8\% more VMT. Relying on 52 mi/gallon hybrid electric SAVs, as opposed to a 31 mi/gallon conventional drivetrain SAV, is estimated to lower travelers’ energy use by 21\% and reduce tailpipe emissions by 30\%, assuming no new or longer trips. Similarly, a 106 mi/gallon equivalent battery-electric fleet does much better by lowering energy use by 64\%.},

An agent-based simulation framework is used to compute and internalize user-speciﬁc external congestion effects and noise exposures. The resulting user equilibrium corresponds to an approximation of the system optimum. For trafﬁc congestion and noise, single objective optimization is compared with multiple objective optimization. The simulation-based optimization approach is applied to the real-world case study of the Greater Berlin area. The results reveal a negative correlation between congestion and noise. Nevertheless, the multiple objective optimization yields a simultaneous reduction in congestion and noise. During peak times, congestion is the more relevant external effect, whereas, during the evening, night and morning, noise is the more relevant externality. Thus, a key element for policy making is to follow a dynamic approach, i.e. to temporally change the incentives. During off-peak times, noise should be reduced by concentrating trafﬁc ﬂows along main roads, i.e. inner-city motorways. In contrast, during peak times, congestion is reduced by shifting transport users from the inner-city motorway to smaller roads which, however, may have an effect on other externalities.},

	title = {Compatibility of {Automated} {Vehicles} in {Street} {Spaces}: {Considerations} for a {Sustainable} {Implementation}},
	abstract = {Automated Vehicles (AVs) will bring a fundamental change in the mobility sector in the coming years. Whereas many studies emphasize opportunities with AVs, studies on the impacts of AVs on travel behavior particularly show an overall increase in trafﬁc volume. This increase could impair the needs of other uses and users within street spaces and decrease the permeability of the street space for pedestrians and cyclists. However, only a few studies, so far, have looked at the changes of trafﬁc volume due to AVs at the street level, and to what extent these impair the needs of other uses and users within different street spaces was not in the focus at all. This paper investigates the compatibility of AVs in street spaces, building on different modeling results of scenarios with AVs based on the Multi-Agent Trafﬁc Simulation (MATSim) framework. Using the so-called compensatory approach and the whole street network of Vienna, Austria, as a case study, we examine how compatible AVs and their related changes in trafﬁc volume are with the needs of other uses and users, i.e., pedestrians and cyclists, within different street spaces, by speciﬁcally considering the various characteristics of the latter. Results show that the effects of AVs on the compatibility of street spaces would be unevenly distributed across the city. For Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs), a deterioration in compatibility is observable, especially in inner-city dense areas, because of an increase in trafﬁc volume and an already high amount of competing uses. In contrast, especially (on main roads) in the outskirts, improvements in compatibility are possible. This particularly applies to SAVs with a stop-based service. However, private AVs interlinked with an overall capacity increase would lead to a deterioration in compatibility, especially in parts of the higher-level street network that already have incompatible trafﬁc volumes, further increasing the separating or barrier effect of such streets. The results can provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders about where and how to facilitate AVs, to reach an implementation that is compatible with the different uses and needs of users within street spaces: While SAVs should be implemented particularly in the outskirts, as a complement for public transport, an implementation of AVs in the lower-level street network in inner parts of the city should not be facilitated, or it should at least be linked to measures that make street spaces more compatible with the needs of pedestrians and cyclists, e.g., implementation of walking and cycling infrastructure.},

We study the impacts of AB deployment in line-based public transport (PT) systems. In particular, we examine the transition phase where AB is sequentially deployed, involving the selection of lines for which AB will be introduced. To this end, we develop a modeling framework using a dynamic public transportation assignment and operations simulation model that captures users’ adaptive path choices. An analytical model is used to determine the initial solutions in terms of service frequency and vehicle capacity for the simulation framework. Due to their different cost function structures, the deployment of AB may be accompanied by changes in the service frequency and vehicle capacity settings and consequently also on passenger flow distribution across the network. Both the simultaneous and the sequential deployment of AB on multiple lines are investigated. Deployment solutions are assessed in terms of the both total operator and user cost. The decision variables are vehicle capacity per line, service frequency per line and vehicle technology per line - i.e. either manually driven or fully automated buses. The framework is applied to a case study in Kista, Stockholm. The study shows that AB service have the potential to attract passengers through improved service provision. A sensitivity analysis is carried out concerning the effects of different cost parameters and demand levels on the deployment of AB in fixed line operations.},

	abstract = {With the increasing quantity of private cars, curb parking has evolved into an important approach to mitigate parking pressure in urban cities. While some efforts have been made for the demand analysis of point-of-interest (POI) and pattern analysis of human mobility, which may indirectly reﬂect the parking situation in urban area, there is a lack of comprehensive models for the parking demand, so as to make a prediction for the road sections without parking lots. In this paper, by focusing on curb parking and designing a systemic framework, named Curb Parking Demand Estimation (CPDE), we model the public parking demand in urban area, w.r.t. parking durations and regional characteristics. Speciﬁcally, we use taxi destinations and the distribution of POIs to quantitatively analyze the regional characteristics, designing corresponding features, and propose a K-means-based Least Square (KLS) method to relate parking characteristics, namely, the temporal parking durations and the corresponding demands, with these features. In this way, we effectively avoid the geographical sparsity of road parking sections and can ﬁnely estimate parking durations and demands for newly developed districts without parking data. Moreover, we give a strategy, named Parking Types Estimation (PTE), which projects estimated parking durations and demands onto Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to accurately measure the distribution of demands over different parking durations for a road section. At last, we conduct experiments on a real-world curb parking dataset in Hefei, a provincial city in China. This dataset contains parking orders of 2016 over the urban area of Hefei. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our methods, and show that our framework outperforms the stateof-the-art baseline schemes.},

The holistic approach evaluates technical feasibility, system cost, energy demand, transportation time, and sustainability-related impacts of various decarbonization strategies. In contrast to previous work, the consequences of a transformation to fully decarbonized transport system scenarios are quantiﬁed across all trafﬁc segments, considering procurement, operation, and disposal. The methodology can be applied to arbitrary regions and transport systems. Here, the metropolitan region of Berlin is chosen as a demonstration case. The ﬁrst results are shown for a complete conversion of all trafﬁc segments from conventional propulsion technology to battery electric vehicles. The transition of private individual trafﬁc is analyzed regarding technical feasibility, energy demand and environmental impact. Commercial goods, municipal trafﬁc and public transport are analyzed with respect to system cost and environmental impacts. We can show a feasible transition path for all cases with substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions. Based on current technologies and today’s cost structures our simulation shows a moderate increase in total systems cost of 13–18\%.},

On the other hand, new transportation trends, such as shared mobility and autonomous driving, carry the potential to disruptively change conventional practices. In this study, we develop an activity-based transport demand model to quantify the effects of potential influencing factors on urban transportation in a syn­ thetic city. We develop 18 scenarios to investigate urban transportation against the backdrop of mode availability, the deployment of shared mobility services, urban structure and societal change, such as urbanization and an aging population, as well as behavioral shifts in mode choice preferences. With respect to the results, we highlight the derived modal split for a city without private cars but with access to shared autonomous vehicles for all agents: We find a distribution of mode choices of 55\% for walking and biking, 40\% for public transportation and 5\% for shared modes. Given this modal split, the total driven distance, as well as the total number of vehicles in the city, decreases by over 90\% against current levels. Thus, an efficient future urban transport system should build upon public transportation for meeting the major share of transport demand, with slow modes for convenient travel across short distances and shared mobility for the inter­ modal connection of both.},

	abstract = {Creating sustainable urban futures partly requires reducing car-use and transport induced stresses on the envi­ ronment and society. New transport technologies such as autonomous vehicles are increasingly assuming prominence in debates about the transition toward sustainable urban futures. Yet, enormous uncertainties currently exist on how autonomous vehicles might shape urban mobility. To address this gap, this paper ex­ amines the latent behavioural and socio-demographic factors that will drive the adoption of and preferences for different use options of autonomous vehicles, utilizing survey data from Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Based on this, it explores how autonomous vehicles might shape travel behaviors through mode choice and the potential sustainability implications. The findings show that regarding preferences for a specific alternative (i.e. sharing, ownership and public transport), attitudes toward these use options matter the most, rather than overall perceived benefits of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, for single mode options, shared-autonomous vehicles remain the least popular, while preference for ownership of autonomous vehicles, either as a single option or in combination with sharing and public transport, is high. Across the different autonomous vehicles options, there is high preference for clean engine fuel sources (i.e. electric and hybrid). Given the embeddedness of preferences for autonomous vehicles in attitudes and choices regarding existing forms of motorized transport, it is possible that the current modal split and the large share of private car-based transport, might not change in the era of autonomous mobility. However, urban transport policy can leverage the overall positive attitudes toward the environment, sharing and public transit to nudge choices toward achieving the normative goals of sustainable urban transport.},

The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule trav­ elers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from repre­ sentative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts.},

With no human drivers, SATs urgently require precise traffic information in order to plan accurate paths independently; in addition, on-time arrival is an essential service quality in SAT systems. In this study, taxis are assumed to be replaced with ride-sharing autonomous vehicles. To improve the probability of on-time arrival, the reliable path concept and collected travel time information are used to facilitate path finding for SATs, and the potential benefits are examined. Two simulation scenarios—one based on historical traffic information and the other based on real-time traffic information—are executed to evaluate the information’s usefulness in reliable path finding. In simulation results, reliable path scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than shortest path scenarios, in which the shortest path algorithm is used in path finding for SATs, and the historical information-based scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than the real-time information-based scenarios. A system-beneficial path finding method is proposed and is verified to be effective for mitigating road network congestion.},

A widely adopted matching strategy is to accumulate a batch of potential passenger-driver matches and solve bipartite matching problems repeatedly. The eﬃciency of matching can be improved substantially if the matching is delayed by adaptively adjusting the matching time interval. The optimal delayed matching is subject to the trade-oﬀ between the delay penalty and the improved matching reward and is dependent on the system’s supply and demand states. Searching for the optimal delayed matching policy is challenging, as the current policy is compounded with past actions. To this end, we tailor a family of reinforcement-learning-based methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality and sparse reward issues. In addition, this work provides a solution to spatial partitioning balance between the state representation error and the optimality gap of asynchronous matching. Lastly, we examine the proposed methods with real-world taxi trajectory data and garner managerial insights into the general delayed matching policies.},

	abstract = {In a mobility-on-demand system, travel requests are handled by a ﬂeet of shared vehicles in an on-demand fashion. An important factor that determines the operational efﬁciency and service level of such a mobility-on-demand system is its operational policy that assigns available vehicles to open passenger requests and relocates idle vehicles. Previously described operational policies are based on control theoretical approaches, most notably on receding horizon control. In this work, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to design an operational policy for a mobility-on-demand system. In particular, we propose a cascaded learning framework to reduce the number of state-action pairs which allows for more efﬁcient learning. We train our model using the AMoDeus simulation environment and real taxi trip travel data from the city of San Francisco. Finally, we demonstrate that our reinforcement learning based operational policy for mobility-on-demand systems outperforms state-of the art ﬂeet operational policies that are based on conventional control theoretical approaches.},

	abstract = {Enabling Ride-sharing (RS) in existing Mobility-ondemand (MoD) systems allows to reduce the operating vehicle ﬂeet size while achieving a similar level of service. This however requires an efﬁcient vehicle to multiple requests assignment, which is the focus of most RS-related research, and an adaptive ﬂeet rebalancing strategy, which counter-acts the uneven geographical spread of demand and relocates unoccupied vehicles to the areas of higher demand. Existing research into rebalancing generally divides the system coverage area into predeﬁned geographical zones, however, this is done statically at design-time and can limit their adaptivity to evolving demand patterns. To enable dynamic, and therefore more accurate rebalancing, this paper proposes a Dynamic Demand-Responsive Rebalancer (D2R2) for RS systems. D2R2 uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering to determine relocation zones at runtime. D2R2 re-calculates zones at each decision step and assigns them relative probabilities based on current demand. We demonstrate the use of D2R2 by integrating it with a Deep Reinforcement Learning multi-agent RS-enabled MoD system in a ﬂeet of 200 vehicle agents serving 10,000 trips extracted from New York taxi trip data. Results show a more fair workload division across the ﬂeet without loss of performance with respect to waiting time and distribution of passengers per vehicle, when compared to baselines with no rebalancing and static pre-deﬁned equiprobable zones.},

	abstract = {With the increasing quantity of private cars, curb parking has evolved into an important approach to mitigate parking pressure in urban cities. While some efforts have been made for the demand analysis of point-of-interest (POI) and pattern analysis of human mobility, which may indirectly reﬂect the parking situation in urban area, there is a lack of comprehensive models for the parking demand, so as to make a prediction for the road sections without parking lots. In this paper, by focusing on curb parking and designing a systemic framework, named Curb Parking Demand Estimation (CPDE), we model the public parking demand in urban area, w.r.t. parking durations and regional characteristics. Speciﬁcally, we use taxi destinations and the distribution of POIs to quantitatively analyze the regional characteristics, designing corresponding features, and propose a K-means-based Least Square (KLS) method to relate parking characteristics, namely, the temporal parking durations and the corresponding demands, with these features. In this way, we effectively avoid the geographical sparsity of road parking sections and can ﬁnely estimate parking durations and demands for newly developed districts without parking data. Moreover, we give a strategy, named Parking Types Estimation (PTE), which projects estimated parking durations and demands onto Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to accurately measure the distribution of demands over different parking durations for a road section. At last, we conduct experiments on a real-world curb parking dataset in Hefei, a provincial city in China. This dataset contains parking orders of 2016 over the urban area of Hefei. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our methods, and show that our framework outperforms the stateof-the-art baseline schemes.},

The holistic approach evaluates technical feasibility, system cost, energy demand, transportation time, and sustainability-related impacts of various decarbonization strategies. In contrast to previous work, the consequences of a transformation to fully decarbonized transport system scenarios are quantiﬁed across all trafﬁc segments, considering procurement, operation, and disposal. The methodology can be applied to arbitrary regions and transport systems. Here, the metropolitan region of Berlin is chosen as a demonstration case. The ﬁrst results are shown for a complete conversion of all trafﬁc segments from conventional propulsion technology to battery electric vehicles. The transition of private individual trafﬁc is analyzed regarding technical feasibility, energy demand and environmental impact. Commercial goods, municipal trafﬁc and public transport are analyzed with respect to system cost and environmental impacts. We can show a feasible transition path for all cases with substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions. Based on current technologies and today’s cost structures our simulation shows a moderate increase in total systems cost of 13–18\%.},

On the other hand, new transportation trends, such as shared mobility and autonomous driving, carry the potential to disruptively change conventional practices. In this study, we develop an activity-based transport demand model to quantify the effects of potential influencing factors on urban transportation in a syn­ thetic city. We develop 18 scenarios to investigate urban transportation against the backdrop of mode availability, the deployment of shared mobility services, urban structure and societal change, such as urbanization and an aging population, as well as behavioral shifts in mode choice preferences. With respect to the results, we highlight the derived modal split for a city without private cars but with access to shared autonomous vehicles for all agents: We find a distribution of mode choices of 55\% for walking and biking, 40\% for public transportation and 5\% for shared modes. Given this modal split, the total driven distance, as well as the total number of vehicles in the city, decreases by over 90\% against current levels. Thus, an efficient future urban transport system should build upon public transportation for meeting the major share of transport demand, with slow modes for convenient travel across short distances and shared mobility for the inter­ modal connection of both.},

	title = {Can autonomous vehicles enable sustainable mobility in future cities? {Insights} and policy challenges from user preferences over different urban transport options},
	abstract = {Creating sustainable urban futures partly requires reducing car-use and transport induced stresses on the envi­ ronment and society. New transport technologies such as autonomous vehicles are increasingly assuming prominence in debates about the transition toward sustainable urban futures. Yet, enormous uncertainties currently exist on how autonomous vehicles might shape urban mobility. To address this gap, this paper ex­ amines the latent behavioural and socio-demographic factors that will drive the adoption of and preferences for different use options of autonomous vehicles, utilizing survey data from Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Based on this, it explores how autonomous vehicles might shape travel behaviors through mode choice and the potential sustainability implications. The findings show that regarding preferences for a specific alternative (i.e. sharing, ownership and public transport), attitudes toward these use options matter the most, rather than overall perceived benefits of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, for single mode options, shared-autonomous vehicles remain the least popular, while preference for ownership of autonomous vehicles, either as a single option or in combination with sharing and public transport, is high. Across the different autonomous vehicles options, there is high preference for clean engine fuel sources (i.e. electric and hybrid). Given the embeddedness of preferences for autonomous vehicles in attitudes and choices regarding existing forms of motorized transport, it is possible that the current modal split and the large share of private car-based transport, might not change in the era of autonomous mobility. However, urban transport policy can leverage the overall positive attitudes toward the environment, sharing and public transit to nudge choices toward achieving the normative goals of sustainable urban transport.},

The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule trav­ elers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from repre­ sentative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts.},

We study the effectiveness of online solution algorithms for this proposed strategy. Queueing-theoretic vehicle dispatch and idle vehicle relocation algorithms are customized for the problem. Several experiments are conducted first with a synthetic instance to design and test the effectiveness of this integrated solution method, the influence of different model parameters, and measure the benefit of such cooperation. Results suggest that rideshare vehicle travel time can drop by 40–60\% consistently while passenger journey times can be reduced by 50–60\% when demand is high. A case study of Long Island commuters to New York City (NYC) suggests having the proposed operating strategy can substantially cut user journey times and operating costs by up to 54\% and 60\% each for a range of 10–30 taxis initiated per zone. This result shows that there are settings where such service is highly warranted.},

A non-myopic atomic game is formulated to address competition for parking through assignment of vehicles to candidate parking facilities that takes into account the differences in travel times for the vehicles from their point of origin to the parking facilities and the differences in walking times for the drivers from the parking facilities to their final destination, as well as dynamic pricing, cruising times, and occupancies of the parking facilities. This study integrates a socially efficient price that accounts for the waiting times of drivers in their search for parking. We incorporate a game model into the social optimum problem by considering the competition of drivers for parking spaces where the drivers’ preferences are reflected in a collective decision such as social welfare. Using actual parking data for the city of San Francisco, we found that under our proposed dynamic parking system the average social welfare per vehicle improved by up to 54\% compared to other parking strategies.},

Increasingly, platforms emerge as facilitators for this kind of collaborative transportation. However, individual actors connected to a platform might refuse to share (parts of) their information due to reasons of competition. Though the need for realistic information sharing models is widely ac­ knowledged by transportation researchers and practitioners, the precise value of such information is mostly unknown. We investigate the quality of solutions that can be obtained when different types and levels of carrier data are available. We consider an auction-based Multi-Agent System to solve large-scale, dynamic pickup and delivery problems, and vary whether carriers’ positions or route plans are available, and whether carriers are fully cooperative or more competitive in placing their bids by sharing or hiding their marginal costs. In total, we evaluate 9 different information sharing policies. The availability of vehicle position and route plan information turns out to be important for decreasing total route costs, and sharing marginal costs has a positive impact on service level. We provide detailed insights into trade-offs of carriers’ confidentiality concerns and a range of system performance objectives (service level, travel costs, and carrier profits) under different circumstances (various numbers of auctions, penalties for re­ jected orders, emission or congestion fees, and different problem characteristics). Based on these results, platform providers can stimulate sharing of certain information to improve the total system efficiency.},

In this paper the time–space prism framework is used to assess sensitivity of PPA size to different parameters and to build choice sets for regional destination choice models. We explain the implication of different parameters to choice set formation in a step-wise manner and illustrate not only the complexity of the idea and the high computational demand but also behavioral realism. In this context, this paper tests the feasibility of using constraint-based time–space prism to ﬁnd the choice sets for a large-scale destination choice model, and identiﬁes a variety of implementation issues. Computational demand is estimated based on a household travel survey for the Southern California Association of Government, and the feasibility of using time–space prisms for destination choice models is assessed with different levels of information on the network and destinations available. The implications of time of day effects and ﬂexibility in scheduling on choice set development due to varying level of service on the network and availability of activity opportunities are discussed and numerically assessed.},

	abstract = {The recent technological innovations in various ICT platforms have given rise to innovative mobility solutions. Such systems could potentially address some of the inherent shortcomings of a line/schedule based public transport system. Previous studies either assumed that flexible ondemand services are used as an exclusive door-to-door service or offered as a feeder connection to high-capacity public transport services. However, users may combine line/schedule based public transport systems (Fixed PT) and on-demand services (Flexible PT) so that their travel impedance is minimized. To this end, we propose a multimodal route choice and assignment model that allows users combining Fixed and Flexible PT or use them as individual modes while demand for these services is endogenously determined. The model takes into account the dynamic demand–supply interaction using an iterative learning framework. Flexible public transport can be used to perform any part of the trip, ranging from a first/last mile service to an exclusive direct door-to-door connection. The developed model is implemented in an agent based simulation framework. The model is applied to a network centered around the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Scenarios where Fixed PT and Flexible PT are offered as mutually exclusive modes or can be combined into a single journey, are analysed. Results indicate that Flexible PT is predominantly used for covering {\textless}30\% of the trip length, indicating that it is mainly used as an access or egress mode to Fixed PT. This results with an overall increase in the share of public transport trips. Also, the average waiting time of Flexible PT users when used in combination with Fixed PT are lower than the scenario where each of them is used as an exclusive mode.},

Pertinently, an SAV typology is presented and the components involved in modelling SAV services are described.

	abstract = {Shared fleets of fully automated vehicles (SAVs) coupled with real-time ride-sharing to and from transit stations are of interest to cities and nations in delivering more sustainable transportation systems. By providing first-mile last-mile (FMLM) connections to key transit stations, SAVs can replace walk-to-transit, drive-to-transit, and drive-only trips. Using the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) toolkit, this paper examines mode splits, wait times, and other system features by microsimulating two fleets of SAVs providing an FMLM ride-sharing service to 10\% of central Austin’s trip-makers near five light-rail transit stations. These trips either start or end within two geofenced areas (called automated mobility districts [AMDs]), and travel time and wait time feedbacks affect mode choices. With rail service headways of 15 min, and 15 SAVs serving FMLM connections to and from each AMD, simulations predict that 3.7\% of the person-trip-making will shift from driving alone to transit use in a 3 mi 3 6 mi central Austin area. During a 3-h morning peak, 30 SAVs serve about 10 person-trips each (to or from the stations), with 3.4 min average wait time for SAVs, and an average vehicle occupancy of 0.74 persons (per SAV mile-traveled), as a result of empty SAV driving between riders. Sensitivity analysis of transit headways (from 5 to 20 min) and fleet sizes (from 5 to 20 vehicles in each AMD) shows an increase in FMLM mode share with more frequent transit service and larger fleet size, but total travel time served as the biggest determinant in trip-makers’ mode share.},

	abstract = {The growing demand for urban mobility highlights the need for relevant and sustainable solu­ tions in cities worldwide. Thus, we develop and implement a framework to analyze the systemic impacts of future urban mobility trends and policies. We build on prior work in classifying the world’s cities into 12 urban typologies that represent distinct land-use and behavioral char­ acteristics by introducing a generalized approach for creating a detailed, simulatable prototype city that is representative of a given typology. We then generate and simulate two auto-depen­ dent (largely US-specific) prototype cities via a state-of-the-art agent-based platform, SimMobility, for integrated demand microsimulation and supply mesoscopic simulation. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing the impacts of automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) implementation strategies in the cities based on demand, congestion, energy consumption and emissions outcomes. Our results show that the introduction of AMoD cannibalizes mass transit while increasing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and congestion. In sprawling auto-dependent cities with low transit penetration, the congestion and energy consumption effects under bestcase assumptions are similar regardless of whether AMoD competes with or complements mass transit. In dense auto-dependent cities with moderate transit modeshare, the integration of AMoD with transit yields better outcomes in terms of VKT and congestion. Such cities cannot afford to disinvest in mass transit, as this would result in unsustainable outcomes. Overall, this framework can provide insights into how AMoD can be sustainably harnessed not only in low-density and high-density auto-dependent cities, but also in other typologies.},

In this paper, a way to mitigate that imbalance is discussed, which is relocating vehicles between stations. For this purpose, two methods are presented, i.e., a new mathematical model to optimize the relocation operations that maximize the proﬁtability of a carsharing service and a simulation model to study different real-time relocation policies. Both methods were applied to networks of stations in Lisbon, Portugal. Results show that relocating vehicles, using any of the methods developed, can produce signiﬁcant increases in proﬁt. For instance, in the case where the carsharing system provides maximum coverage of the city area, the imbalances in the network resulted in an operating loss of C1160/day when no relocation operations were performed. When relocation policies were applied, however, the simulation results indicate that proﬁts of C854/day could be achieved, even with increased costs due to relocations. Using the mathematical model, the results are even better, with a reached proﬁt of C3865.7/day. This improvement was achieved through reductions in the number of vehicles needed to satisfy the demand and the number of parking spaces needed at stations. These results demonstrate the importance of relocation operations for proﬁtably providing a network of stations in one-way carsharing systems that covers the entire city, thus reaching a higher number of users.},

The decision support tool is composed of three elements: a forecasting model, an assignment model and a filter. Two assignment models are proposed and tested: rule-based and optimization. The rule-based model uses simple rules to respond to system status changes, and the optimization model is a mixed integer programing (MIP) model prepared to work in real-time. A simulator was designed to test the decision support tool and an application is done to the city of Lisbon, Portugal, showing that the benefits of staff relocations can be rather low. It was verified that the number of relocations that can physically be performed by each staff member in the case study provide only a small improvement in the revenues, which is unlikely to overcome the costs associated with hiring and staff activity.},

First, we show a complete de-generalization of activity diaries to simulate the socioeconomic features and longitudinal sequences of geographically and temporally explicit activities. Second, we introduce a differential privacy approach to control the level of resolution disclosing the uniqueness of survey participants. Finally, we experiment using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We evaluate the statistical distributions, pairwise correlations and measure the level of privacy guaranteed on simulated datasets for varying noise. The results of the model show successes in simulating activity diaries composed of multiple outputs including structured socio-economic features and sequential tour activities in a differentially private manner.},

	abstract = {MATsim is a flexible agent based transport simulator. Its flexibility derives from the high number of parameters that control the behavior of its simulations. For these simulations to be representative of what is observed in reality, these parameters require to be calibrated by hand. This process can be tedious and time consuming. In this work, we propose an automatic calibration procedure for MATsim based on batch multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO). We cast the calibration problem as an optimization problem, where we minimize the mismatch of aggregate measures of traffic events, such as travel time distribution, between the output of MATsim and real world observations. This optimization problem is non-convex and does not have an analytical form. Furthermore, the evaluation of its objective function is computationally expensive. Bayesian Optimization is a black-box, sample efficient, global optimization algorithm that is well suited for this kind of problems. Moreover, it can be adapted to parallel evaluations and it naturally accommodates different levels of approximation of the objective function, which can easily be obtained from MATsim and can speed up the optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MF-BO for the calibration of MAStim on both small (Sioux Falls) and large scale (Zurich) scenarios.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the demand for emerging transportation technologies and policies can vary by time of day due to spillbacks on roadways, rescheduling of travelers’ activity patterns, and shifting to other modes that affect the level of congestion. These effects are not well-captured with static travel demand models. We calibrate and validate the first open-source multi-agent simulation model for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating policies such as congestion pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is loaded with an 8M + synthetic 2016 population calibrated in a prior study. The road network is calibrated to INRIX speed data and average annual daily traffic for a screenline along the East River crossings, resulting in average speed dif­ ferences of 7.2\% on freeways and 17.1\% on arterials, leading to average difference of +1.8\% from the East River screenline. Validation against transit stations shows an 8\% difference from observed counts and median dif­ ference of 29\% for select road link counts. The model is used to evaluate a congestion pricing plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggests a much higher (127K) car trip reduction compared to their report (59K). The pricing policy would impact the population segment making trips within Manhattan differently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan: benefits from congestion reduction benefit the former by about 110\%+ more than the latter. The multiagent simulation can show that 37.3\% of the Manhattan segment would be negatively impacted by the pricing compared to 39.9\% of the non-Manhattan segment, which has implications for redistribution of congestion pricing revenues. The citywide travel consumer surplus decreases when the congestion pricing goes up from \$9.18 to \$14 both ways even as it increases for the Charging-related population segment. This implies that increasing pricing from \$9.18 to \$14 benefits Manhattanites at the expense of the rest of the city.},

A description is given of the core utilities in the kit: a parallel discrete event engine, interprocess exchange engine, and memory allocator, as well as a number of ancillary utilities: visualization library, database IO library, and scenario manager. The overall framework emphasizes the design goals of: generality, code agility, and high performance. This framework allows the modeling of several aspects of transportation system that are typically done with separate stand-alone software applications, in a high-performance and extensible manner. The issue of integrating such models as dynamic trafﬁc assignment and disaggregate demand models has been a long standing issue for transportation modelers. The integrated approach shows a possible way to resolve this difﬁculty. The simulation model built from the POLARIS framework is a single, shared-memory process for handling all aspects of the integrated urban simulation. The resulting gains in computational efﬁciency and performance allow planning models to be extended to include previously separate aspects of the urban system, enhancing the utility of such models from the planning perspective. Initial tests with case studies involving trafﬁc management center impacts on various network events such as accidents show the potential of the system.},

After estimation, it is common practice to use aggregate measurements to calibrate the estimated model-system’s parameters prior to their application in transportation planning, policy making, and operations. However, calibration of activity-based model-systems has received much less attention. Existing calibration approaches are myopic heuristics in the sense that they do not consider the fundamental inter-dependencies among choice-models and do not have a systematic way to adjust model parameters. Also, other purely simulation-based approaches do not perform well in large-scale applications. In this study, we focus on utility-maximizing nested logit activity-based modelsystems and calibrating aggregate statistics such as activity shares, mode shares, time-dependent \& mode-specific OD flows, and time-dependent \& mode-specific sensor counts. We formulate the cali­ bration problem as a simulation-based optimization problem and propose a stochastic gradient-based solution procedure to solve it.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a method to study travel behaviour dynamics by constructing detailed synthetic pseudo panels from repeated cross-sectional data is presented. The method is based on the modelling of a high-dimensional joint distribution of travel preferences conditional on detailed socio-economic profiles by using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). The CVAE is a neural-network-based generative model which allows the modelling of very detailed joint and conditional distributions, potentially defined by dozens or even hundreds of attributes in a flexible non-parametric form. The proposed method is used to rank detailed cohorts of individuals into slow and fast movers with respect to the speed at which their travel behaviour change over time. This gives an interesting insight into the types of individuals who are easily motivated to change their behaviour as opposed to those who are less flexible. Specifically, we investigate the dynamics of transport preferences for a fixed pseudo panel of individuals from a large Danish cross-sectional data set covering the period from 2006 to 2016. The comparison of the travel preference distributions from 2006 and 2016 shows that the prototypical fast mover is a single young woman who lives in a large city, whereas the typical slow mover is a middle-aged man with high income from a nuclear family who lives in a detached house outside a city. However, given that it is possible to rank individuals across very detailed socio-economic classifications, many other relationships can be explored. Finally, the CVAE can be directly applied to the population synthesis problem in microsimulation by modelling the distribution of socioeconomic profiles conditional on other variables.},

MATSim (Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation) is the only high-resolution spatially-explicit framework that allows intrinsic population downscaling - simulating the entire system's dynamics based only on a fraction k of the traveling population. Till now, the choice of k was dictated by hardware performance, and a common rule was not to downscale below 10\%. We investigate downscaling in MATSim by comparing the aggregate and disaggregate statistics that describe the dynamics of car traffic in fullscaled and downscaled simulations of the Sioux Falls test case road network. Simulations with 25\% or higher shares of the traveler population preserve all major urban traffic statistics. Within the 10-25\% interval, downscaling becomes unstable for some of the statistics. For scenarios that are downscaled 10\% and below, statistics can substantially deviate from the full-scale model. We further discuss the problems related to a multimodal transportation simulation's downscaling that also includes public transportation.},

Applying the models to the city of Berlin, Germany, we compare impacts in scenarios with home delivery from points of sale in the year 2030, assuming two different market shares for e-food and hot and mild air temperatures. The results show that home delivery decreases VKT and emissions, but total CO2 emissions are much higher when food cooling is included in hot scenarios and moderately higher or decreasing in mild scenarios as refrigerator units increase fuel con­ sumption and, thus, freight transport emissions by factor two to five as compared to driving. Urban areas are more affected by adverse effects while remote and less dense areas benefit. These findings show the need for considering cooling in analyses of the effects of grocery home delivery and call for the use of more energyefficient and less polluting technologies in delivery vehicles for driving and chilling.},

We propose a novel modeling framework which jointly predicts the average total value of e-commerce purchase, the purchase amount per transaction, and delivery option choices. The proposed framework can simulate the changes in e-commerce delivery demand attributable to the changes in delivery options. We assume the model parameters based on various sources of relevant information and conduct a demonstrative sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we have applied the model to the simulation for the Auto-Innovative Prototype city.

	abstract = {Using publicly available microdata sets, we show how estimates for online delivery purchases can be generated for small geographic areas defined in our study as micro analysis zones (MAZ) and how these estimates vary across the MAZs that featured in our study. With a focus on Miami-Dade County, we use both the national household travel survey (NHTS) data and synthetic data obtained from Southeast Florida Regional Planning Model (SERPM) to generate demand estimates of online delivery purchases for more than 5300 distinct geographic units in Miami-Dade County. We assess the quality of the estimates using measures of predictive accuracy and by comparing the cumulative values obtained with the population estimates generated from the NHTS survey data for Miami-Dade County. Our approach fills a void in the area of purchases of online delivery items where rich observable data are typically unavailable and it also provides the added potential benefit of being easily replicated nationwide given the emphasis on the use of publicly available data.},

	abstract = {The transport impacts of collection-delivery points (CDPs), as an alternative to home delivery, are rarely studied. As e-shopping becomes increasingly popular, trips to collect deliveries at CDP, especially by car travel, may generate a considerable amount of external effects, such as emissions. Therefore, this paper analysed the ‘‘picking up/leaving goods” trips selected from the Swedish National Travel Survey and jointly modelled the individuals’ mode choice and trip chaining decisions using a panel cross-nested logit model. The roles of trip chain characteristics, individual socio-demographics and land use characteristics on each trip chain and mode choice combination are investigated. The results indicate observed and unobserved heterogeneities of trip chaining and mode choice decisions among populations. Young adults living with partners/spouses, single adults with children and partnered adults with children have the preference of using cars in collection-delivery trips compared to other life-cycle groups. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to estimate the effect of distance to CDPs on vehicle kilometres travelled. The calibrated model is used to estimate the VKT of collection-delivery trips in the greater Stockholm area. The results indicate a 22.5\% reduction of VKT from collection-delivery trips by relocating 5\% CDPs from urban areas to suburban and rural areas.},

	abstract = {Urban deliveries are traditionally carried out with vans or trucks. These vehicles tend to face parking difficulties in dense urban areas, leading to traffic congestion. Smaller and nimbler vehicles by design, such as cargo-cycles, struggle to compete in distance range and carrying capacity. However, a system of cargo-cycles complemented with strategically located cargostoring hubs can overcome some limitations of the cargo-cycles. Past research provides a limited perspective on how demand characteristics and parking conditions in urban areas are related to potential benefits of this system. To fill this gap, we propose a model to simulate the performance of different operational scenarios—a truck-only scenario and a cargo-cycle with mobile hubs scenario—under different delivery demand and parking conditions. We apply the model to a case study using data synthesized from observed freight-carrier demand in Singapore. The exploration of alternative demand scenarios informs how demand characteristics influence the viability of the solution. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis clarifies the contributing factors to the demonstrated results. The combination of cargo-cycles and hubs can achieve progressive reductions in kilometers-traveled and hours-traveled up to around densities of 150 deliveries/km2, beyond which savings taper off. Whereas the reduction in kilometers-traveled is influenced by the the carrying capacity of the cargo-cycle, the reduction in hours-traveled is related to to the cargo-cycle ability to effectively decrease the parking dwell time by reducing, for instance, the time spent searching for parking and the time spent walking to a delivery destination.},

Automated technologies in freight transportation represent an opportunity to develop more ef­ ficient systems characterized by the integration of different and complementary modes. In this study, we focus on the possibility of implementing an integrated truck-robot system for the lastmile delivery. This typology of problem shares similarities with truck-drone problems, although robots are characterized by much slower speeds and can perform several consecutive deliveries. Based on these particular features, a heuristic that efficiently identifies solutions based on initial truck tours and corresponding joint robot operations is presented. This solution approach le­ verages a special version of the “Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem,” which allows for a very efficient Dynamic Programming solution. The developed solution approach is adopted to analyze the influence on efficiency of different features concerning the robot’s design and operation, and the surrounding environment. The results show that robot-assisted last-mile delivery systems are quite efficient if robots are employed in heavily congested areas and appropriately retrofitted to accommodate several compartments in the robot’s storage.},

	abstract = {E-Commerce and package deliveries are growing at a fast pace and there is an increased demand for same-day deliveries. Established delivery companies and new startups are investing in technologies that reduce delivery times or increase delivery drivers’ productivity. In this context, the adoption of sidewalk automated (or autonomous) delivery robots (SADRs) has a growing appeal. SADRs are pedestrian sized robots that deliver items to customers without the intervention of a delivery person. Because SADRs travel on sidewalks they have been the subject of increasing regulation by local agencies in the U.S. The three research questions that guide this research effort are: (a) What are the limitations imposed by existing regulations in the U.S.?, (b) What are the technical capabilities of existing SADRs?, and (c) Given the existing capabilities and regulations, what are the time/cost savings and efficiencies that SADRs can bring about? The first part of the research discusses current U.S. regulations on SADRs and reviews existing SADR devices and their capabilities. Building on this knowledge, the second half of the research presents a novel model to estimate delivery time and number of customers served utilizing a combination of SADRs and a special delivery van. These results are compared with a baseline (or prevailing) delivery system utilizing only a conventional delivery van and human driver. Results, insights, and potential implications are discussed. The results show that SADRs can provide substantial cost and time savings in some scenarios. Furthermore, the introduction of SADRs may significantly reduce on-road travel per package delivered.},

While in the empirical literature the choice usually boils down to picking one single measure, this research proposes a flexible approach in which several measures may be used in parallel to capture the surrounding economic landscape. This is intended to acknowledge that interactions between agents may take several forms, occurring through different channels and as such being based on different measures. The methodology is applied to the location choice of establishments in the Paris region, using a mixture of ”mono-distance” hurdle-Poisson models. Seven distance measures are considered: Euclidean distance, the travel times by car (for the peak and off-peak periods) and by public transit, and the corresponding network distances. For all the economic sectors considered, the mixture of hurdle-Poisson models performs significantly better than the “pure” mono-distance models. This corroborates that local spatial spillovers are indeed channeled by different means, hence best represented using several measures. The combination of peak and off-peak road travel times (slightly) outperforms other combinations including the Euclidean distance, supporting the choice of meaningful over more abstract measures in spatial econometric models. The distance measure most likely to capture local spatial spillovers varies depending on the economic sector examined, reflecting differences between sectors in operations and location choice criteria.},

	abstract = {On-demand systems in which several users can ride simultaneously the same vehicle have great potential to improve mobility while reducing congestion. Nevertheless, they have a significant drawback: the actual realization of a trip depends on the other users with whom it is shared, as they might impose extra detours that increase the waiting time and the total delay; even the chance of being rejected by the system depends on which travelers are using the system at the same time. In this paper we propose a general description of the sources of unreliability that emerge in ridesharing systems and we introduce several measures. The proposed measures are related to two sources of unreliability induced by how requests and vehicles are being assigned, namely how users’ times change within a single trip and between different realizations of the same trip. We then analyze both sources using a state-of-the-art routing and assignment method, and a New York City test case. Regarding same trip unreliability, in our experiments for different fixed fleet compositions and when reassignment is not restricted, we find that more than one third of the requests that are not immediately rejected face some change, and the magnitude of these changes is relevant: when a user faces an increase in her waiting time, this extra time is com­ parable to the average waiting time of the whole system, and the same happens with total delay. Algorithmic changes to reduce this uncertainty induce a trade-off with respect to the overall quality of service. For instance, not allowing for reassignments may increase the number of rejected requests. Concerning the unreliability between different trips, we find that the same origin-destination request can be rejected or served depending on the state of the fleet. And when it is served the waiting times and total delay are rarely equal, which remains true for different fleet sizes. Furthermore, the largest variations are faced by trips beginning at high-demand areas.},

	abstract = {On-demand systems in which passengers with similar routes can share a vehicle are expected to become a relevant part of future mobility, thanks to their flexibility and their potential impact on reducing congestion. Nevertheless, due to the long detours required by a door-to-door scheme, they induce extra costs to the users in terms of delay. In this paper, we face the design of such a system in which users might be requested online to walk towards/from nearby pick-up/drop-off points if this improves overall efficiency. We show theoretically that the general problem becomes more complex (as it contains two sub-problems that extend set-cover), analyze the trade-offs that emerge, and provide a general formulation and specific heuristics that are able to solve it over large instances. We test this formulation over a real dataset of Manhattan taxi trips (9970 requests during one hour), finding that (a) average walks of about one minute can reduce the number of rejections in more than 80\% and Vehicles-Hour-Traveled in more than 10\%, (b) users who depart or arrive at the most demanded areas are more likely to be required to walk, and (c) the per­ formance improvement of the service is larger when the system receives more trip requests.},

	abstract = {With ongoing developments in digitalization and advances in the ﬁeld of autonomous driving, ondemand ride pooling is a mobility service with the potential to disrupt the urban mobility market. Nevertheless, to apply this kind of service successfully efﬁcient algorithms have to be implemented for effective ﬂeet management to exploit the beneﬁts associated with this mobility service. Especially real time computation of ﬁnding beneﬁcial assignments is a problem not solved for large problem sizes until today. In this study, we show the importance of using advanced algorithms by comparing a fast, but simple insertion heuristic algorithm with a state-of-the-art multi-step matching algorithm. We test the algorithms in various scenarios based on private vehicle trip OD-data for Munich, Germany. Results indicate that in the tested scenarios by using the multi-step algorithm up to 8\% additional requests could be served while also 10\% additional driven distance could be saved. However, computational time for ﬁnding optimal assignments in the advanced algorithm exceeds real time rather fast as problem size increases. Therefore, several aspects to reduce the computational time by decreasing redundant checks of the advanced multi step algorithm are introduced. Finally, a reﬁned vehicle selection heuristic based on three rules is presented to furthermore reduce the computational effort. In the tested scenarios this heuristic can speed up the most cost intensive algorithm step by a factor of over 8, while keeping the number of served requests almost constant and maintaining around 70\% of the driven distance saved in the system. Considering all algorithm steps, an overall speed up of 2.5 could be achieved.},

	abstract = {Mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems, especially ride-hailing systems, have seen tremendous growth in recent years. These systems provide user-centric mobility services, whose users expect a high level of convenience. Waiting for a response after an app request and eventually learning after a long period of time that no vehicle is available is hardly acceptable. This study investigates the use-case where users should be served within a certain maximum waiting time. Under certain assumptions, which are reasonable for an attractive MoD business model, it can be shown that an operator using dynamic state optimization can communicate a rejection to users after the ﬁrst iteration, thereby eliminating unnecessary waiting time before these users would leave the system. Furthermore, early operator rejections reduce the dimension of subsequent customer-vehicle assignment problems, thereby saving computational resources and solving the problems faster. In turn, this allows shorter re-optimization cycles and once again faster responses, i.e. a better user experience.},

An emerging field of research aims at finding the best way to operate these systems given certain targets, e.g., customer service level or the minimization of fleet distance. In this work, we introduce a new element of fleet operation: the assignment of idle vehicles to a limited set of parking spots. We present two different parking operating policies governing this process and then evaluate them individually and together on different parking space distributions. We show that even for a highly restricted number of available parking spaces, the system can perform quite well, even though the total fleet distance is increased by 20\% and waiting time by 10\%. With only one parking space available per vehicle, the waiting times can be reduced by 30\% with 20\% increase in total fleet distance. Our findings suggest that increasing the parking capacity beyond one parking space per vehicle does not bring additional benefits. Finally, we also highlight possible directions for future research such as to find the best distribution of parking spaces for a given mobility-on-demand system and city.},

Long-term choices include mobility tool ownership and work locations. Daily travel patterns are simulated at the individual level by sequentially combining activity frequency, activity durations and destinations as well as a rule-based time-of-day scheduling. A key to success in this novel approach is balancing individual preferences of travelers with system constraints. The model incorporates two types of constraints: 1) capacity constraints of the transport infrastructure. 2) natural time and space constraints during the execution of individual 24-hour day plans. Model results are validated against empirical observations of travel demand in Switzerland. The article concludes with a perspective for further research and development in the field of applied agent-based modeling.},

            Agent-based models for dynamic traffic assignment simulate the behaviour of individual, or group of, agents, and then the simulation outcomes are observed on the scale of the system. As large-scale simulations require substantial computational power and have long run times, most often a sample of the full population and downscaled road capacities are used as simulation inputs, and then the simulation outcomes are scaled up. Using a massively parallelized mobility model on a large-scale test case of the whole of Switzerland, which includes 3.5 million private vehicles and 1.7 million users of public transit, we have systematically quantified, from 6 105 simulations of a weekday, the impacts of scaled input data on simulation outputs. We show, from simulations with population samples ranging from 1\% to 100\% of the full population and corresponding scaling of the traffic network, that the simulated traffic dynamics are driven primarily by the flow capacity, rather than the spatial properties, of the traffic network. Using a new measure of traffic similarity, that is based on the chi-squared test statistic, it is shown that the dynamics of the vehicular traffic and the occupancy of the public transit are adversely impacted when population samples less than 30\% of the full population are used. Moreover, we present evidence that the adverse impact of population sampling is determined mostly by the patterns of the agents’ behaviour rather than by the traffic model.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the potential environmental impacts of a large-scale deployment of off-hour deliveries (OHD), focusing on CO2 and pollutant emissions. We use a methodological frame­ work involving four steps: transport demand estimation, traffic simulation, emissions calculation and emissions environmental social cost calculation. Based on five scenarios, depending on the scale of the shift to OHD, and applied to the case of the Lyon urban area, we find that OHDs lead to a reduction in CO2 and pollutant emissions. However, their impact is rather small. The maximum reduction in CO2 emissions is 3.4\% for 100\% OHD for the whole urban area of Lyon (1.9 million inhabitants and 3325 km2). Some factors (population size, density, traffic conditions, research methodology, vehicle fleet composition, etc.) limit the comparability of the results ob­ tained from other case studies. One of the reasons for this low environmental impact of OHDs is that the LUA is a small and not very congested metropolitan area. This impact is 5\% when we focus on the densest area (core of area with 0.7 million inhabitants on 2.2\% of surface area) which is more important than in the least dense area (outskirts of area with 0.6 million inhabitants on 83.6\% of surface area) with 2.6\%. These results confirm the limited impacts of OHDs in smaller, less congested urban areas. It also reaffirms the need for OHDs to be implemented in the densest parts of metropolitan areas. The maximum decrease in the environmental social cost is 4.25 million euros per year. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the adoption of OHD makes it possible to achieve gains of 2.5 million hours per year in travel time that augur a productivity gain for all the actors involved in urban goods movement.},

We develop a modeling chain including a freight demand model, a multiclass traﬃc assignment model, and a road emission model. This allows for a detailed representation - spatially and with regard to operations - of urban road freight. We ﬁnd that while urban road freight represents only 6\% of trips and 8\% of distances traveled by road in the Paris region, it accounts for 36\% of total damages caused by pollutant emissions from road traﬃc. This is the combined result of light and heavy goods vehicles emitting more than private cars, and of freight traﬃc being more spatially concentrated (within the city center) than passenger traﬃc, thereby aﬀecting more population. All in all, the environmental cost of urban road freight is around 2.1 billion € per year. Some policy implications are discussed.},

The target of this paper is to expose one of the ﬁrst widely operable methods used in urban freight modelling and its main outputs through the FRETURB design. By reviewing the complete process of its construction, starting with the identiﬁcation of urban policy needs, the relevant survey and databases construction methods, the modelling allowing the simulation of the eﬀects of governance, we illustrate through the French case what are the elements of success for such a scientiﬁc endeavour. The adaptation of freight models to the urban environment strongly relies on an eﬃcient unit of observation, which is introduced as the spine of the model after discussing the main approaches of urban freight transport modelling. The main features of the model are then presented from the generation to the distribution of freight operations and are confronted to elements of validation. The robustness of the model is also discussed through time by analysing elements of its initial calibration 20 years ago and the latest results of urban freight surveys in order to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. We show that the model is able to summarize eﬃciently the urban freight transport phenomenon and is still statistically robust twenty years after its ﬁrst design although it needs marginal adaptations on organisational elements.},

	abstract = {Service reliability of public transportation (PT) systems is a dominant ingredient in what is perceived as the PT image. Unreliable service increases the uncertainties of simultaneous arrivals of vehicles at a transfer point. Implementing proper control actions leads to preventing missed transfers, one of the undesirable features of PT service and a major contributor to a negative image. The present work focuses on performance measurements of a PT system offering direct transfers on multi-legged trips. The method developed evaluates and improves system performance by applying selected operational tactics in real-time scenarios. In order to investigate the efﬁciency level of the PT system, ﬁve types of vehicle positional situations with reference to a transfer point are considered: considerably ahead of schedule, ahead of schedule, on schedule, behind schedule, and considerably behind schedule. Each situation contributes differently to the degree of system performance. The optimization framework developed results in selected operational tactics to attain the maximum number of direct (without waiting) transfers and minimize total passenger travel time. The implementation of the concept is performed in two steps: optimization and simulation. The optimization process searches for the best operational tactics, using the states of the ﬁve vehicle-position types, and the simulation serves to validate the optimal results under a stochastic framework using the concept of a multi-agent system. A case study of Auckland, New Zealand, is described for assessing the methodology developed. Results showed a 58\% improvement in the system performance index compared to no-tactic operations.},

This paper proposes rigorous mathematical descriptions to describe the effects of information availability to passengers, including the user equilibrium and non-equilibrium solutions. The information availability in disruption is summarised in a “who-when-where-what” four-dimensional framework. Based on different information, passengers’ behaviours are assumed and simulated to evaluate the benefits of information availability in public transport disruption. An agent-based micro-simulation model (MATSim) is applied for the city of Zürich, Switzerland, for the benefit of activity-based simulation in a multi-modal network. We use an existing day-to-day replanning method, and extend the study with a within-day replanning approach in MATSim, to study agents’ route choices responding to public transport disruption in one single iteration. The disruption is assumed as a rail track blockage between Zürich HB and Zürich Oerlikon via both Zürich Wipkingen and Zürich Hardbrücke. One benchmark of agents’ behaviours without disruption and other three scenarios based on different information are simulated. Statistic results are analysed for all the agents who may be involved in the defined disruption. Agents’ flow in related transit routes and transport modes shows their adaptations to the corresponding information availability. Agents’ delays and scores reveal that information significantly impacts agents’ satisfaction in public transport disruption.},

The characteristics of the trip length distributions (TLDs) are examined, defined in terms of tons, as required in commodity-based modeling, and in vehicle trips, as required in trip-based modeling. With data used from a major transportation study in Guatemala, the TLDs are estimated for both tons and vehicle trips. The analysis revealed that ( a) the shape of the TLDs depends upon the type of movements being considered; ( b) TLDs defined in terms of tonnage differ significantly from those defined in terms of vehicle trips; ( c) TLDs for different types of vehicles, transporting similar commodities, reflect the range of use of each type of vehicle; ( d) though tons TLDs and vehicle TLDs are different, the relationship between them seems to follow a systematic pattern that, if successfully identified, would enable transportation planners to estimate one type of TLD given the other; and ( e) major freight generators affect the shape of the TLDs, so complementary models may be needed to provide meaningful depictions of freight movements.},

	abstract = {Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model—a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.},

As the agency responsible for transportation planning and programming in Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs comprehensive tools for understanding the demands of the freight transportation sector and the effects of transportation investment on this sector. A project was undertaken to design a comprehensive, innovative, multimodal modeling framework to support freight transportation decision making in Los Angeles County. The proposed modeling approach combines elements of two state-of-the-art freight modeling techniques: logistics chain modeling and tour-based truck modeling. The reasons for selecting this approach are described; background on the modeling techniques is provided; and integration of the two methods into a comprehensive modeling framework is discussed.},

The choice is closely related to the mode of transportation and therefore important for public policy. The theory of optimal shipment size and mode choice is robust. Numerous inventory-theoretical models of optimal shipment size are applied by shippers in operational contexts. However, none has been validated empirically over a large and heterogeneous population of shipments, and thus none are useful for modeling freight transportation demand, particularly because of the lack of adequate data. The simple economic order quantity (EOQ) model was assessed empirically on a national scale over a heterogeneous population of shipments. The French ECHO database, which observed commodity flow rates between shippers and receivers, was used to estimate the EOQ shipment size specification, and the validity of the EOQ model was confirmed. The study revealed the dominant role of the commodity flow rate between shipper and receiver and of commodity value density. The relationship between mode choice and shipment size is highlighted.},

	abstract = {This paper conducts a comparative analysis of two alternative approaches to freight generation modeling: ordinary least square (OLS) and cross classification. OLS models were estimated to identify a functional relationship between the number of freight deliveries per day and a set of company attributes used as independent variables. Cross-classification techniques aim at identifying a classification structure that provides a good representation of the freight generation process. To that effect, multiple classification analysis was used to identify groups of independent variables explaining freight generation, which provided the basis for constructing cross-classification tables. In both cases freight generation is explained as a function of company attributes. The model estimation process used data obtained from commercial establishments located in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York. More than 190 different variables were tested as predictors for the number of deliveries received or carried per day. Six linear regression models found to be statistically significant and conceptually valid are discussed. Establishment attributes such as industry segment, commodity type, facility type, total sales, and number of employees were found to be statistically significant. The OLS models indicated that industry segment and commodity type are strong predictors of freight generation. It was also noticed that many of these variables played a significant role when interacting with economic variables such as total sales or employment. Twelve different groups of independent variables predicting freight generation were found to be significant as part of the cross-classification models. Results indicate that as in the case of regression models, commodity type, industry segment, and employment are strong predictors for freight generation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a heuristic model based on Gaussian processes to determine synthetic sets of trips in urban networks, considering only supplyrelated information. This is an alternative to the benchmark method used in the literature, which consists of repeating several trials of Monte Carlo simulations and therefore requiring a complex calibration task and large computational resources. The developed heuristic model explicitly leverages the probabilistic nature of Gaussian processes and exploits their properties to iteratively select origin–destination (od) pairs of nodes in the city network. The model then determines the shortest trip in distance for the selected od pairs and appends it to the synthetic set. We discuss the implementation and performance of both the benchmark method and the developed heuristic model on two city networks. We show that the presented model is more robust and computationally efficient than the benchmark method. This is evidenced by its ability to determine synthetic sets with much smaller sizes, naturally reducing the computational burden, when compared to the benchmark method. We also discuss how the choice of the kernel function and calibration of the hyperparameters influence the performance of the presented heuristic model.},

Activity-based models overcome many of the limitations of the trip-based model, but implementing and calibrating an activity-based model is labor-intensive and running an activity-based model often takes long runtimes. This paper proposes a hybrid called MITO (Microsimulation Transport Orchestrator) that overcomes some of the limitations of trip-based models, yet is easier to implement than an activity-based model. MITO uses microsimulation to simulate each household and person individually. After trip generation, the travel time budget in minutes is calculated for every household. This budget influences destination choice; i.e., people who spent a lot of time commuting are less likely to do much other travel, while people who telecommute might compensate by additional discretionary travel. Mode choice uses a nested logit model, and time-of-day choice schedules trips in 1-minute intervals. Three case studies demonstrate how individuals may be traced through the entire model system from trip generation to the assignment.},

The approach, called actiTopp, is based on the concept of utility-based regression models and stepwise modeling. In contrast to most of the existing models, actiTopp covers the time period of one week. Few models have covered one week; thus, the activity generation approach of this simulation period is rare. Analysis of weekly activity behavior shows stability between different days (e.g., working durations). Hence, the model explicitly takes these aspects into account, for example, by defining time budgets to spread durations within the week. For model estimation, the study used data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP). This annual survey collects representative data on the travel behavior of the German population. The data from 2004–2013 provide more than 17,500 activity schedules for one week, with more than 450,000 activities. Selected results are shown for the model application to 2014 MOP data, which the study used for validation purposes. The mean value of activities per person and week show a difference of 0.3 activity. To evaluate the model, the study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with a significance level of α = 0.001. For the activity type distribution of the 2014 sample, the analysis could not reject the null hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the model and the survey data at this significance level.},

This travel demand is required to estimate potential external visitors of the future district. A ﬁrst demonstration shows that the model correctly represents the current demands and allows the forecast of future demand in the area.},

This risk makes its usage outside the telecommunication network incompatible with recent data privacy regulations, hampering its adoption in transportation-related applications. To address this issue, we propose a framework designed only with user-aggregated mobile phone data to synthesise realistic daily individual mobility — Digital Twin Travellers. We explore different strategies built around modified Markov models and an adaption of the Rejection Sampling algorithm to recreate realistic daily schedules and locations. We also define a one-day mobility population score to measure the similarity between the population of generated agents and the real mobile phone user population. Ultimately, we show how with a series of histograms provided by the telecommunication service provider (TSP) it is possible and plausible to disaggregate them into new synthetic and useful individual-level information, building in this way a big data travel demand framework that is designed in accordance with current data privacy regulations.},

Activity generation and scheduling components of TASHA are validated using 1996 and 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. This validation proceeds in two parts: (a) verification that TASHA replicates the 1996 base case upon which the model was originally built; and (b) comparison of TASHA’s forecasts of 2001 daily travel behaviour with observed travel survey data for 2001. TASHA activity generation and scheduling model components replicate observed activities with good accuracy and precision for the base year. Although TASHA is not able to predict an observed increase in activity participation rate in a five year forecast, the distribution of activities in the day is forecast with greater success. Predictions of average travel distance are oversimulated in the base year by 0.9\%. Increased average distances are underpredicted for school, shopping, and other activities, and are overpredicted for work and return home activities. These validation results are promising, although there exist opportunities to improve model performance, and to further validate other elements of the TASHA model.},

	abstract = {The advent of autonomous vehicle technologies and the emergence of new ride-sourcing business models has spurred interest in Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD) as a prospective solution to meet the challenges of urbanization. AMOD has the potential of providing a convenient, reliable and affordable mobility service through more competitive cost structures enabled by autonomy (relative to existing services) and more efficient centralized fleet operations. However, the short and medium-term impacts of AMOD are as yet uncertain. On the one hand, it has the potential to alleviate congestion through increased ride-sharing and reduced car-ownership, and by complementing mass-transit. Conversely, AMOD may in fact worsen congestion due to induced demand, the cannibalization of public transit shares, and an increase in Vehicle-Kilometers Traveled (VKT) because of rebalancing and empty trips. This study attempts to systematically examine the impacts of AMOD on transportation in Singapore through agent-based simulation, modeling demand, supply and their interactions explicitly. On the demand side, we utilize an activity-based model system, that draws on data from a smartphone-based stated preferences survey conducted in Singapore. On the supply side, we model the operations of the AMOD fleet (including the assignment of requests to vehicles and rebalancing), which are integrated within a multimodal mesoscopic traffic simulator. Comprehensive simulations are conducted using a model of Singapore for the year 2030 and yield insights into the impacts of AMOD in dense transit-dependent cities from the perspective of the transportation planner, fleet operator, and user. The findings suggest that an unregulated introduction of AMOD can cause significant increases in network congestion and VKT, and have important policy implications that could potentially inform future deployments of AMOD.},

In this study, we investigate the parking choices of privately-owned AVs in a downtown area. Since each user’s choice has impacts on another via cruising-incurred traffic congestion and parking competition, we model the parking choice problem of AVs as a Wardrop equilibrium in which each user cannot further reduce their parking cost by unilaterally changing their choice. The model considers all possible options for parking a private AV, and finds that these parking choices may yield multiple equilibria under which the congestion and social welfare are very different. We further develop an efficient solution algorithm to find all equilibrium solutions. Our analysis shows that even if AVs act in a non-cooperative manner, one possible outcome would involve many AVs choosing to cruise, which creates severe congestion to decrease the cost of cruising. However, this outcome can be avoided by a time-based congestion toll, which dis­ courages AVs from cruising for a long period and increases the social welfare. Our analysis also shows parking pricing and provision may not reduce congestion induced by cruising AVs without the help of a congestion toll.},

The hybrid method balances curb lanes for driving or parking, aiming to minimise the average trafﬁc delay. The model is tested using an idealised grid layout with a range of ﬂow rates and parking policies. Results demonstrate delay decreased by 9\%-27\% from the benchmark case. Additionally, the trafﬁc delay distribution shows the tradeoffs between expanding road capacity and minimising trafﬁc demand through curb management, indicating the interplay between curb parking and trafﬁc management in the AV era.},

Based on the SAV scenario, this paper reviews the current research on the sustainable renewal of urban public parking spaces, and proposes the four key issues involved: how much to renew (i.e., demand forecast analysis), when to renew (i.e., update time series evaluation), what to renew (i.e., function replacement decision) and how to update (i.e., design empirical research). Furthermore, it puts forward a preliminary idea on, and constructs a research framework for, the sustainable renewal methods of parking space under the SAV scenario. Finally, the theoretical, practical and policy implications of the research on sustainable renewal methods of urban public parking space are discussed. It will have great reference value for the redevelopment and reuse of the urban space types including fragmented, widely distributed and large-scale.},

	abstract = {Fully automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to drive empty (without a passenger). For privately-owned AVs, such empty repositioning has the potential benefit of avoiding parking costs at their destination. AV owners could have their vehicle drop them off at their destination, then drive elsewhere to park. Although previous studies have considered the congestion effects of AVs repositioning to park at their owner’s residence, this study models the choice of parking location when AVs reposition away from the traveler’s destination. We model this behavior through a modified static traffic assignment with a logit model for destination choice, in which AV passenger-carrying trips can create a second empty repositioning trip to an alternate parking zone. The traffic assignment is formulated as a variational inequality. Numerical results on the Chicago sketch network show the effects of AV market penetration, fuel costs, and parking fees on the number of repositioning trips, as well as the impacts of repositioning trips on network congestion. Next, we study the problem of adjusting zone-specific parking costs to influence the repositioning behavior. In particular, when zones have asymmetric parking infrastructure costs, optimized parking fees combined with empty repositioning can encourage AVs to park at cheaper locations, thus reducing the land used for parking at zones with high land value. This network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program. Since it is bi-level and non-convex, a genetic algorithm is used to find a good solution. Results on the Sioux Falls test network show that the adjusted parking costs are effective at reducing the congestion caused by empty repositioning and encouraging more optimal parking choices for repositioning AVs.},

Inspired by the well-known Lotka-Volterra equations, a mathematical model is developed to explicitly incorporate the interactions among those parking garages under consideration. Time-dependent parking space availability is considered as the system state, while the dynamic price of parking is naturally used as the control input which can be properly chosen by the parking garage operators from the admissible set. By regulating parking rates, the total demand for parking can be distributed among the set of parking lots under question. Further, we formulate an optimal control problem (called Bolza problem) with the objective of maintaining the availability (managing the demand) of each parking garage at a desired level, which could potentially reduce traffic congestion as well as fuel consumption of CAVs. Based on the necessary conditions of optimality given by Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP), we develop a computational algorithm to address the nonlinear optimization problem and formally prove its convergence. A series of Monte Carlo simulations is conducted under various scenarios and the corresponding optimization problems are solved determining the optimal pricing policy for each parking lot. Since the stochastic dynamic model is general and the control inputs, i.e., parking rates, are easy to implement, it is believed that the procedures presented here will shed light on the parking management of CAVs in the near future.},

	abstract = {Growth in e-commerce has led to increasing use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62\% of the total vehicle round time and 40\% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.},

	abstract = {Approaches to space-related problems that model decision-making and interactions at the level of individuals, and thus require disaggregated population data (i.e. specifying all attributes for each individual) are increasingly being used in various research domains. Actual population data is generally unavailable due to conﬁdentiality and cost constraints. Therefore, synthetic population generation techniques based on aggregated marginal constraints and a random sample are often used. The two sample-based techniques most frequently used are Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) coupled with integerization and Simulated Annealing (SA) (SA is a special case of Combinatorial Optimization, CO). Several authors have emphasized the need for further research on comparing their relative performance. Thus, a methodology encompassing statistical analysis to compare IPF and SA is presented here. Technique performance is evaluated through the percentage classiﬁcation error of the generated population against the reference population. Two cases are analyzed using the 2001 census microdata in Andalusia (Spain) and the 2000 Swiss Public Use Sample as reference populations, encompassing 6 sociodemographic attributes plus geographic location (municipalities and cantons). Aggregated marginal constraints and random samples are calculated from the reference population. A set of synthetic small area populations are generated using both techniques for various scenarios within each case, corresponding to diﬀerent combinations of sample sizes, number of categories and number of generated populations. Results reveal the great importance of the integerization process applied to IPF's output. IPF coupled with a marginal distributions-controlled rounding outperforms populations generated with SA in all scenarios, while as SA generally outperforms IPF coupled with the commonly used Monte Carlo rounding.},

This type of data has mainly been used to provide more detailed census data and for spatial microsimulation modelling: for example to analyse social policy and population changes, transportation, marketing strategies or health outcomes. We argue that many potential applications for synthetic spatial microdata remain to be developed. One reason for this is the lack of information about and conﬁdence in this type of data. Introductory literature about creating synthetic spatial microdata and discussions on the decisions that need to be taken during the data generation process are rare. In this paper, we therefore review currently existing methods to generate synthetic spatial microdata in a manner which will support most readers who are considering this approach, and we address the main issues of the data generation process with regards to analyses of neighbourhood level data. We discuss further possible applications of these data and the importance of synthetic spatial microdata.},

These surveys are usually capable of producing direct estimates at the national level and high level regions but often cannot produce reliable estimates for smaller areas. Due to the increasing demand for comprehensive statistical information not only at the national level but also for sub-national domains, there is a wide discussion in the literature about the use of statistical techniques that combine survey with census data to provide more detailed, ﬁner-level estimates.},

	abstract = {The use of micro-models as supplements for macro-models has become an accepted approach into the investigation of urban dynamics. However, the widespread application of micro-models has been hindered by a dearth of individual data, due to privacy and cost constraints. A number of studies have been conducted to generate synthetic individual data by reweighting large-scale surveys. The present study focused on individual disaggregation without micro-data from any large-scale surveys. Speciﬁcally, a series of steps termed Agenter (a portmanteau of ‘‘agent producer’’) is proposed to disaggregate heterogeneous agent attributes and locations from aggregate data, small-scale surveys, and empirical studies. The distribution of and relationships among attributes can be inferred from three types of existing materials to disaggregate agent attributes. Two approaches to determining agent locations are proposed here to meet various data availability conditions. Agenter was initially tested in a synthetic space, then veriﬁed using the acquired individual data, which were compared to results generated using a null model. Agenter generated signiﬁcantly better disaggregation results than the null model, as indicated by the proposed similarity index (SI). Agenter was then used in the Beijing Metropolitan Area to infer the attributes and location of over 10 million residential agents using a census report, a household travel survey, an empirical study, and an urban GIS database. Agenter was validated using micro-samples from the survey, with an average SI of 72.6\%. These ﬁndings indicate the developed model may be suitable for using in the reproduction of individual data for feeding micro-models.},

Based on two open source soft­ ware packages, MATSim and NoiseModelling, this framework aims to simulate the spatiotemporal distributions of daily individual activity and road traffic noise. The proposed approach allows to use the tools and methods proposed in the NoiseModelling software by importing MATSim out­ puts, therefore, taking full advantage of the development work carried out within the two communities. As such, it enables both characterizing the individual exposure to road trafficrelated noise and investigating noise exposure inequality problems based on the attributes of individuals and their activities.},

	abstract = {The family of natural evolution strategies (NES) oﬀers a principled approach to real-valued evolutionary optimization by following the natural gradient of the expected ﬁtness. Like the well-known CMA-ES, the most competitive algorithm in the ﬁeld, NES comes with important invariance properties. In this paper, we introduce a number of elegant and eﬃcient improvements of the basic NES algorithm. First, we propose to parameterize the positive deﬁnite covariance matrix using the exponential map, which allows the covariance matrix to be updated in a vector space. This new technique makes the algorithm completely invariant under linear transformations of the underlying search space, which was previously achieved only in the limit of small step sizes. Second, we compute all updates in the natural coordinate system, such that the natural gradient coincides with the vanilla gradient. This way we avoid the computation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, which is the main computational bottleneck of the original NES algorithm. Our new algorithm, exponential NES (xNES), is signiﬁcantly simpler than its predecessors. We show that the various update rules in CMA-ES are closely related to the natural gradient updates of xNES. However, xNES is more principled than CMA-ES, as all the update rules needed for covariance matrix adaptation are derived from a single principle. We empirically assess the performance of the new algorithm on standard benchmark functions.},

	abstract = {Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) is a concept that has recently generated much discus­ sion. In cases where large-scale adoption of an automated taxi service is anticipated, the service’s impacts may become relevant to key transport system metrics, and thus to transport planners and policy-makers as well. In light of this increasingly important question, this paper presents an agent-based transport simulation with (single passenger) AMoD. In contrast to earlier studies, all scenario data (including demand patterns, cost assumptions and customer behaviour) is obtained for one specific area, the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The simulation study fuses information from a detailed bottom-up cost analysis of mobility services in Switzerland, a specifically tailored Stated-Preferences survey about automated mobility services conducted in the canton of Zurich, and a detailed agent-based transport simulation for the city, based on MATSim. Methodologically, a comprehensive approach is presented that iteratively runs these components to derive states in which service cost, waiting times and demand are in equilibrium for a cost-covering AMoD operator with predefined fleet size. For Zurich, several cases are examined, with 4,000 AMoD vehicles leading to the maximum demand of around 150,000 requests per day that can be attracted by the system. Within these parameters, the simulation results show that customers are willing to accept average waiting times of around 4 min at a price of 0.75 CHF/km. Further costcovering cases with lower demand are presented, where either smaller fleet sizes lead to higher waiting times, or larger fleet sizes lead to higher costs. While our simulations indicate that an AMoD system in Zurich can bring benefits to the users, they show that the system impact is largely negative. Caused by modal shifts, our simulations show an increase of driven distance of up to 100\%. All examined fleet configurations of the unregulated, cost-covering, single-passenger, door-to-door AMoD service are found to be highly counter-productive on a path towards a more shared and active transport system. Accordingly, policy recommendations for regulation are discussed.},

This review argues that these factors are evidently demonstrating forces behind urban freight transportation and thus are more determinative for carrying out urban freight modeling.

	abstract = {As part of a broader vision for emission-free city logistics, the city of Rotterdam plans to introduce a zero-emission zone in combination with urban consolidation centers (UCCs) on the outskirts of the city to generate a shift to zero-emission vehicles. For the design of this zero-emission zone, several research questions arise that require a systematic analysis of the impacts of the transition scenarios on freight demand patterns, the use and market shares of new (zero-emission) vehicles, and the impacts of truck flow and emissions. As a case study, we implemented heterogenous transition scenarios for each logistic segment into the Tactical Freight Simulator from the HARMONY project and analyzed the systemwide impacts. This model is multiagent, empirical, and shipment based and simulates long-term tactical choices (distribution channel choice, shipment size and vehicle type choice, sourcing) and short-term tactical choices (tour formation, delivery times). Results showed that the impact of UCCs is not trivial: we observed a small increase in vehicle kilometers traveled overall of +0.25\%, which can be attributed to the rerouting of shipments through the UCCs. Calculations confirmed that emissions reduced dramatically, by 90\%, inside the zero-emission zone. At the city scale this corresponds to a reduction of almost 10\%, as most freightrelated traffic is generated by the port and involves long-haul heavy goods vehicle transport that does not enter the city center. At a regional level, impact reduction was very small. More measures are needed if more ambitious reductions in emissions are to be achieved.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, the construction industry has been attracted to modular construction because of its beneﬁts for reduced project scheduling and costs. However, schedule deviation risks in the logistics process of modular construction can derail its beneﬁts and thus interfere with its widespread application. To address this issue, we aim to develop a digital twin framework for real-time logistics simulation, which can predict potential logistics risks and accurate module arrival time. The digital twin, a virtual replica of the physical module, updates its virtual asset based on building information modeling (BIM) in near real-time using internet of thing (IoT) sensors. Then, the virtual asset is transferred and exploited for logistics simulation in a geographic information system (GIS)-based routing application. We tested this framework in a case project where modules are manufactured at a factory, delivered to the site via a truck, and assembled onsite. The results show that potential logistical risks and accurate module arrival time can be detected via the suggested digital twin framework. This paper’s primary contribution is the development of a framework that mediates IoT, BIM, and GIS for reliable simulation which predicts potential logistics risks and accurate module delivery time. Such reliable risk prediction enables effective supply chain coordination, which can improve project performance and the widespread application of modular construction.},

The tasks for the city administration have become more complex, whereas tools and methods are often based on traditional, static approaches while involving a limited number of citizens and stakeholders in relevant decisions. The digital transformation of more and more pieces of the planning and decision-making process will make both increasingly more illustrative, easier to understand and more comprehensible. An important data basis for these processes is the digital twin of the City of Zurich. 3D spatial data and their models transform themes of the city, such as buildings, bridges, vegetation, etc., to the digital world, are being updated when required, and create advantages in digital space. These benefits need to be highlighted and published. An important step in public awareness is the release of 3D spatial data under Open Government Data. This allows the development of applications, the promotion of understanding, and the simplification of the creation of different collaborative platforms. By visualization and analysis of digital prototypes and the demonstration of interactions with the built environment, scenarios can be digitally developed and discussed in decision-making bodies. Questions about the urban climate can be simulated with the help of the digital twin and results can be linked to the existing 3D spatial data. Thus, the 3D spatial data set, the models and their descriptions through metadata become the reference and must be updated according to the requirements. Depending on requirements and questions, further 3D spatial data must be added. The description of the 3D spatial data and their models or the lifecycle management of the digital twin must be carried out with great care. Only in this way, decision processes can be supported in a comprehensible way.},

	abstract = {UAE is among the fastest-growing e-commerce country in the Middle East, and this provides ample growth opportunity to the last mile parcel /courier delivery companies. Yet, the sector struggles to achieve its objective of providing exemplary customer satisfaction and minimizing the operating cost. This paper explores the challenges faced by the logistics companies engaged in the last mile delivery of e-commerce parcels. Firstly, in most countries of the Middle East including UAE there is “ No descriptive delivery address “available ,which means no postal codes or Zip codes of the final delivery point and secondly, most of the logistics provider still operate on legacy driven semi - digitized track \& trace systems for the transportation and customer relation management. This leads to the poor last-mile delivery performance of the logistics provider ultimately impacting the e-commerce brand reputation. To increase efficiency, there is a need to embrace innovative technologies and integrate the supply chain key partners. Based on the exploratory study, we suggest a conceptual framework based on integrated technologies like GPS, IoT, and TMS which will provide the delivery operator with real-time visibility, reliability, and a smart last-mile solution. The unique three technology blend will provide full digitization of the core operations, seamless co-ordination with multiple sources, data-based decision making and real-time visibility.},

The investigated problem is concerned with the routing of a set of delivery vans equipped with a number of self-driving parcel delivery robots.

	abstract = {The paper develops a simulation model and evaluates fixed versus on-demand operational designs of a station-based automated feeder service. The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of-service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation framework in evaluating trade-offs between fixed and on-demand service design variables and their effects on disaggregate level-of-service provided for stop-based feeder services.},

In combination with these technical potentials, novel mobility concepts as for instance demand responsive transportation (DRT) can improve the everyday mobility of people in terms of both cost-efficiency and sustainability. Moreover, challenges related to demographic transitions and urbanisation can be addressed and negative developments mitigated. One potential application of DRT might be the connection of rural areas with the urban core. The following paper aims to evaluate the viability and feasibility of DRT systems in the interplay of rural and urban areas. The city of Bremerhaven and the immediate surrounding are selected as area of investigation and the agent-based modelling framework MATSim is used to simulate the inhabitant mobility behaviour. On this basis, the global operational costs are calculated for different scenarios, e.g. fully automated vehicles and various powertrain types. The results imply that automated DRT systems are applicable to reduce the economic and environmental costs of transportation when applied in the interplay of rural and urban areas.},

	abstract = {Providing a railway transit system (RTS) in less populated areas is a challenging task for transportation agencies due to its high construction and operating costs. With the advent of automation, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as an integral part of public transit services has the potential to enhance the design of transit systems. In this paper, we present a joint optimization framework of railway transit network design and SAV first-mile service that minimizes the total cost of the combined RTS-SAV services and commuters’ waiting time, while serving a dynamic travel demand in the network. The proposed model optimizes the SAV fleet size and the RTS alignment while enabling vehicle relocations to tackle the vehicle imbalance issue in the SAV service. Due to the non-linear and mixed-integer formulation, we develop a fixed-point algorithm for this joint RTS-SAV problem where we transform the original problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Our results indicate that the joint RTS-SAV services can be constructed and operated at a lower cost than either of the RTS or SAV services alone. Furthermore, the resulting joint RTS-SAV services are underpinned by a shorter railway alignment and larger fleet size rather than a multi-link extension. Additionally, the joint RTS-SAV services is robust to the variation in total demand, with respect to the railway alignment, SAV utilization and commuters’ waiting time.},

However, in urban areas, there is a negative impact on the traffic volume in terms of additional vehicle kilometres since the bundled public transport demand is replaced by less bundled on-demand vehicles. In rural areas, the increase in vehicle kilometres plays less of a role due to generally low demand. The negative effects per vehicle kilometre are slightly higher in rural areas due to higher empty kilometres and lower bundling rates, but the negative effects per km2 in dense cities are much more serious. Authorities need to consider these effects according to the spatial context when implementing such services.},

	abstract = {The emergence of demand responsive transport (DRT) services is restructuring mobility in the urban universe. They provide a high level of service and in many cases compete with public transportation modes. However, in less dense areas, where conventional public transit (CPT) services such as buses are inefficient and costly, DRT services could be an alternative that is both profitable and provides passenger satisfaction. This paper investigates the economic and socioeconomic potential of replacing CPT with DRT services. In particular, it focuses on the development and combination of two models. The first is an agent-based model, which describes movements of vehicles and assigns them to passengers according to a utility function. The assignment equilibrium problem is solved for demand that is elastic to generalized cost alone. The second is an economic optimization model, based on a simulated annealing algorithm, which aims to determine supply conditions that maximize the benefit for the operator, the user, the environment, and society. Four economic problems are discussed and formulated accordingly. In addition, supply optimization is carried out in particular with respect to fleet size, trip fare, and vehicle capacity. Finally, these models are applied to a real case in the Paris metropolitan area where a bus service has been replaced by a DRT system. The results show that though this shift is not beneficial from a societal point of view, bus demand is attracted by a DRT service consisting of 30 vehicles and charging a fare of €0.5. The operator would aim to propose a taxi-service, with small-sized vehicles and higher fares, in order to increase their profitability. User utility, on the other hand, would suggest that public authorities should regulate fares and vehicle capacity (more than 6 seats). Fare regulation, in particular, will depend on the fleet size, ranging linearly from €0 for 25 vehicles to €4 for 70 vehicles. Finally, we find through the sensitivity analysis that thresholds exist for demand and fixed costs (respectively 85\% and 90\% of reference values) beyond which the bus line is more beneficial to society than the DRT service.},

	abstract = {On-demand transit system designs are explored for the first-mile commuting in Markham, a suburb in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Operational scenarios are analysed using different types of on-demand solutions that can complement the existing GO Transit commuter train system. Various use cases of demand-responsive vehicles are explored in terms of vehicle capacity and fleet-size. It is assumed that the existing car-based trips to the four train stations in Markham would be replaced by an on-demand rideshare transit system. The on-demand transit system is simulated using the PTV MaaS Modeller in combination with a mesoscopic simulation, involving 1,865 trip requests within the morning peak from 7AM to 10AM. Wait-time, travel time, demand served, cost, and environmental impact are used as indicators to rate various options. Evaluating the results we came to the conclusion that three cases using vans are providing favourable outcomes. The van-based scenario using 75\% of an optimal fleet size and a low detour factor turned out to be very appropriate with regard to the case study. A passenger in this scenario would at an average spend 3 min waiting for the service to arrive and 10 min in the vehicle, costing 7CAD for the ride. With a typical level of public transit subsidies applied, a 7\% monthly saving is expected compared to using a private car and paying for parking fees. The scenario also results in 30\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when compared to current personal vehicle based trips. Based on the simulation, policy suggestions for implementing the on-demand transit in Markham are presented.},

	abstract = {High costs of owning fully-automated or autonomous vehicles (AVs) will fuel the demand for shared mobility, with zero driver costs. Although sharing sounds good for the transport system, congestion can easily rise without adequate policy measures. Many or all public transit lines will continue to exist, and carefully-designed policies can be implemented to make good use of fixed public assets, like commuter- and light-rail lines. In this study, a shared AV (SAV) fleet is analyzed as a potential solution to the first-mile-last-mile (FMLM) problem for access to and from public transit. Essentially, SAVs are analyzed as collector-distributor systems for these mass-movers and compared with a door-to-door (D2D) service. Results from an agent-based simulation of Austin, Texas, show that SAVs have the potential to help solve FMLM transit problems when fare benefits are provided to transit users. Restricting SAV use for FMLM trips increases transit coverage, lowers average access and egress walking distance, and shifts demand away from park-and-ride and long walk trips. When SAVs are available for both D2D use and FMLM trips, high SAV fares help maintain transit demand, without which the transit demand may decrease significantly, affecting the transit supply and the overall system reliability. Policy makers and planners should be wary of this shift away from transit and may be able to increase transit usage using policies tested in this study.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a systematic review of studies that model future autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban mobility and logistics using an agent-based model (ABM). Eighty relevant papers published between 2015–2020 are included. This review evaluates the quality of each model through the newly developed AAODD (Autonomous vehicle Agent-based Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol in four perspectives: model transparency, research questions, network+agent behaviour and model execution. Then, similarities and particularities of the papers are summarised based on whether AVs are used for passenger mobility or for freight logistics. The reviewed mobility papers exhibit the ABMs’ applicability and flexibility for studying different AV operational patterns. We summarise the respective modelling specifications in research questions, data collections, model platforms, model executions, and scenario variations. Overall, by combining AVs with different technical possibilities and operational strategies, the simulation results illustrate that AVs would bring vast benefits to urban mobility networks. Unlike AVs’ usage in passenger mobility, it is still unclear how AVs will serve future urban logistics demands. Many operational patterns, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous robots, autonomous trucks, and autonomous cargo-hatching vehicles coexist in the research community. The number of relevant papers remains low due to the early stage of AV technology deployment. However, ABMs also prove their applicability for analysing the macro and mesoscopic impacts of freight AV transportation on urban network. The reviewed papers suggest that implementing AVs for urban logistics is more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional delivery vehicles. Overall, ABMs are a powerful tool for simulating future urban scenarios with AVs. By calculating the average score of reviewed papers obtained via AAODD annually, we find that studies simulating AV systems in ABMs are getting more complex by combing diverse technological possibilities, supporting the simulation of more realistic future scenarios. The outcomes of reviewed ABM research reveals that AVs are a promising solution for solving current urban transport problems. Lastly, as nearly all current reviewed studies focus on AVs’ usages in either mobility or logistics, research on an integrated simulation that combines AVs for both purposes has been scarcely addressed. We discuss its necessities, possibilities, and opportunities in this paper, to steer future research in this direction.},

	abstract = {Activity-based models appeared as an answer to the limitations of the traditional trip-based and tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental assumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent representation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing, and microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential to simulate traffic demand management policies, their practical application is still limited. One of the main reasons is that these models require a huge amount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The work presented here has a twofold objective: first, to demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based transport models, and, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to estimate the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as input for building a transport MATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves the quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon toll policy applied to two different areas of the city and at different times of the day are then studied. Our results show the way in which the modal share is modified in each of the considered scenarios. The possibility of evaluating the effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with the ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area confirm the advantages of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic demand management policies.},

However, directly measuring these externalities at the source is unfeasible. We have therefore developed a pipeline for estimating the generated externalities of recorded trips using the multi-agent simulation software MATSim. First, collected GPS traces are matched to the MATSim network and converted to MATSim events. These events are then processed to impute externalities for each individual. Emission values for various pollutants are calculated for each link using the HBEFA database, accounting for vehicle type, road category and traffic conditions. For congestion, we leverage MATSim modules developed by Kaddoura to compute average link delays for each hour of the day using the MATSim scenario of Switzerland, which are then assigned to links traveled by the participants. We adapt this pipeline to further account for the Swiss valuation of externalities. To validate our approach, the externalities generated for the Swiss MATSim scenario will be compared to ARE estimates and the swiss norm values. The application of the pipeline will be demonstrated for GPS traces collected from the SBB Green Class project.},

	abstract = {Robotic multi-agent systems can efﬁciently handle spatially distributed tasks in dynamic environments. Problem instances of particular interest, and generality are the dynamic traveling repairman problem, and the dynamic vehicle routing problem. Operational policies for robotic ﬂeets solving these two problems take decisions in an online setting with continuously arriving demands to optimize service level, and efﬁciency, and can be classiﬁed along several lines. First, some require a model of the demand, e.g., based on historical information, while others work model-free. Second, they are designed for different operating conditions from light to heavy system load. Third, they work in a time-invariant or time-varying setting. We present a novel class of model-free operational policies for time-varying demands, which have performance independent of the load factor, a combination of properties not achieved by other operational policies in the literature. The underlying principle of the introduced policies is to send available robots to recent service request locations. In simple terms, they rely on sending more than one robot for every service request arriving to the system. This leads to an advantage in scenarios where demand is non-uniformly distributed, and correlated in space, and time. We provide performance guarantees for both the time-invariant, and the time-varying cases as well as for correlated demand. We verify our theoretical results numerically. Finally, we apply our operational policy to the problem of mobility-on-demand ﬂeet operation, and demonstrate that it outperforms model-based, and complex algorithms across all load ranges, despite its simplicity.},

	abstract = {Activity-based modelling is a modern agent-based approach to travel demand modelling, in which the transport demand is derived from the agent’s needs to perform certain activities at specific places and times. The agent’s mobility is considered in a broader context, which allows the activity-based models to produce more realistic trip chains, compared to traditional trip-based models. The core of any activity-based model is an activity scheduler – a software component producing sequences of agent’s daily activities interconnected by trips, called activity schedules. Traditionally, activity schedulers used to rely heavily on hard-coded knowledge of transport behaviour experts. We introduce the concept of a Data-Driven Activity Scheduler (DDAS), which replaces numerous expert-designed components and their intricately engineered interactions with a collection of machine learning models. Its architecture is significantly simpler, making it easier to deploy and maintain. This shift towards data-driven, machine learning based approach is possible due to increased availability of mobility-related data. We demonstrate DDAS concept using our own proof-of-concept implementation, perform a rigorous analysis and compare the validity of the resulting model to one of the rule-based alternatives using the Validation Framework for Activity-Based Models (VALFRAM).},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, the construction industry has been attracted to modular construction because of its benefits for reduced project scheduling and costs. However, schedule deviation risks in the logistics process of modular construction can derail its benefits and thus interfere with its widespread application. To address this issue, we aim to develop a digital twin framework for real-time logistics simulation, which can predict potential logistics risks and accurate module arrival time. The digital twin, a virtual replica of the physical module, updates its virtual asset based on building information modeling (BIM) in near real-time using internet of thing (IoT) sensors. Then, the virtual asset is transferred and exploited for logistics simulation in a geographic information system (GIS)-based routing application. We tested this framework in a case project where modules are manufactured at a factory, delivered to the site via a truck, and assembled onsite. The results show that potential logistical risks and accurate module arrival time can be detected via the suggested digital twin framework. This paper’s primary contribution is the development of a framework that mediates IoT, BIM, and GIS for reliable simulation which predicts potential logistics risks and accurate module delivery time. Such reliable risk prediction enables effective supply chain coordination, which can improve project performance and the widespread application of modular construction.},

The model is used as a surrogate fitness for CMA-ES if the rank correlation between true fitness and surrogate value of recently sampled data points is high. Otherwise, further samples from the current population are successively added as data to the model. We empirically compare the IPOP scheme of the new model assisted lq-CMA-ES with a variety of previously proposed methods and with a simple portfolio algorithm using SLSQP and CMA-ES. We conclude that a global quadratic model and a simple portfolio algorithm are viable options to enhance CMA-ES.

The key idea is to approximate the directions of the local normal vectors of the constraint boundaries by accumulating steps that violate the respective constraints, and to then reduce variances of the mutation distribution in those directions. The resulting strategy is able to approach the boundary of the feasible region without being impeded in its ability to search in directions tangential to the boundaries. The approach is implemented in the (1 + 1)-CMA-ES and evaluated numerically on several test problems. The results compare very favourably with data for other constraint handling approaches applied to unimodal test problems that can be found in the literature.},

The Cholesky update can replace the decomposition only for the update without evolution path and reduces the computational eﬀort from O(n3) to O(n2).

	abstract = {Data play an indispensable role in transport modelling. The availability of data from non-conventional sources, such as mobile phones, social media, and public transport smart cards, changes the way we conduct mobility analyses and travel forecasting. Existing studies have demonstrated the multitude and varied applications of these emerging data in transport modelling. The transferability of current research and further endeavours depend mostly on the availability of these data. Therefore, the openness or public availability of the prominent data for transport modelling needs to be adequately investigated. Such a discussion should also encompass these data’s application aspects to provide a holistic overview. This paper deﬁnes a typology for the data classiﬁcation based on a set of availability or openness attributes from the existing literature. Subsequently, we use the developed typology to classify the prominent transport data into four categories: (i) Commercial data, (ii) Inaccessible data, (iii) Gratis and accessible data with restricted use, and (iv) Open data. Using this typology, we conclude that the public data, which refer to the data that are accessible and free of cost, are a superset of open data. Further, we discuss the applications and limitations of the selected data in transport modelling and highlight in which task(s) certain data excel. Lastly, we synthesise our review using a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to bring out the aspects relevant to data owners and data consumers. Public availability of data can help in various modelling steps such as trip generation, accessibility, destination choice, route choice, network modelling. Complementary datasets such as General Transit Feed Speciﬁcation (GTFS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) increase the usability of other data. Thus, modellers can gain from the positive cascade eﬀect by prioritising these data. There is also a potential for data owners to release proprietary data, such as mobile phone data, with restricted-use licenses after addressing privacy risks. Our study contributes by dealing with two problems at the same time. On the one hand, the paper analyses existing data based on their potential for mobility studies. On the other hand, we classify them based on how open they are. Hence, we identify the most promising public data for developing the next generation of transport models.},

	abstract = {The ﬂexibility of simulators of transport systems often derives from the parameters that control their behaviour. For these simulations to be representative of what is observed in reality, these parameters require to be calibrated. In this work, we propose an automatic low dimensional calibration procedure for transport system simulators based on batch multi-ﬁdelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO). We cast the calibration problem as an optimization problem, where we minimize the mismatch of aggregated measures of traﬃc events, such as travel time distribution, between the output of a transport system simulation and ground truth observations. This optimization problem can not be shown to be convex and does not have an analytical form. Furthermore, the evaluation of its objective function is computationally expensive. Bayesian Optimization is a black-box, sample eﬃcient, global optimization algorithm that is well suited for this kind of problems. Moreover, it can be adapted to parallel evaluations and it naturally accommodates diﬀerent levels of approximation of the objective function, which can be obtained from transport system simulations and can speed up the optimization. We empirically demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of MF-BO for the calibration of key parameters of an agent-based transport simulation and show how to scale the method to higher dimensions.},

An integrated agent-based microsimulation platform provides a rich framework for examining such interventions to assess their impacts using indicators about demand as well as supply side. This paper presents an approach where individual schedules, derived from a lighter version of an activity-based model, are fed into a Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSIM) framework. Simulations are performed for two European cities i.e. Hasselt (Belgium) and Bologna (Italy). After calibrating the modelling framework against aggregate traffic counts for the base case, the impacts of a few traffic management policies (restricting car access, increase in bus frequency) are examined. The results indicate that restricting car access is more effective in terms of reducing traffic from the network and also shifting car drivers/passengers to other modes of travel. The enhancement of bus infrastructure in relation to increase in frequency caused shifting of bicyclist towards public transport, which is an undesirable result of the policy if the objective is to improve sustainability and environment. In future research, the framework will be enhanced to integrate emission and air dispersion models to ascertain effects on air quality as a result of such interventions.},

So far, journey speeds have predominantly been considered as exogenous and invariant to the interaction effects with multi-modal trafﬁc. With growing ﬂeet sizes, the resulting journey speeds can become endogenous in the vehicle routing as they result from the decisions of various multi-modal actors. Thus, proper speed predictions are essential for the delivery service quality and related business decisions. This paper proposes an innovative approach based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to describe multimodal interactions in the endogenous and dynamic evolution of congestion for bi-modal trafﬁc of cars and urban freight vehicles (UFV) for parcel delivery. The approach is abstract and can be applied to any pick-up and delivery service. It helps cities to derive urban freight transport strategies and businesses to make better decisions.},

To date, research based on such simulations is rarely replicable as it is based on proprietary data and tools. To foster the discussion and steer research towards reproducible transport simulations, this paper introduces a process for generating a synthetic travel demand with individual households, persons, and their daily activity chains for Paris and its surrounding region Île-de-France — entirely based on open data and open software and replicable by any researcher. The resulting travel demand is published for others to use as a comprehensive data basis for agent-based transport simulations and as a test bed for population and demand synthesis algorithms. Furthermore, it is discussed how implicit correlation structures impact the potential use cases of the synthetic travel demand for simulation and analysis purposes and how the common practice of using population samples for downstream simulations affects the results.},

The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule trav­ elers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from repre­ sentative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts.},

	abstract = {Although human trajectory data that are collected passively from location-based services (LBS) are regarded as a substitute for household travel surveys that entail a larger cost, the reality is that the data cannot be utilized directly for transportation planning and policy making without imputing missing qualitative information. Deep learning technologies have been widely used to infer the hidden features of passively collected mobile data. A deep neural network, however, is so deterministic that the probabilistic aspect of activity inference cannot be accommodated. In the present study, a stochastic approach (VAE-HMM) was devised to generate human activity chains by incorporating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). Whereas an original HMM clusters data in the observational space, the proposed approach conducts clustering in a latent space with a smaller dimension. The VAE contributes by both reducing the input dimensionality and by sidestepping the overfit to sample data. The variational inference (VI) method was used to estimate the parameters of VAE-HMM within a Bayesian framework. Data drawn from spatio-temporal, demographic, socio-economic, and individual-specific sources were chosen as input variables to feed the model. The VAE-HMM can be trained in either a su­ pervised or an unsupervised manner.},

However, the extent to which network-level macroscopic traffic models may be ready for practical implementation remains to be ascertained. This paper aims to shed light on this matter by reviewing the 50-year history of macroscopic modeling of urban networks and assessing remaining gaps and opportunities for further development of both theory and applications. To this end, the existing literature’s chronology is mapped onto three eras of development, and the corresponding theories, assumptions, and limitations are outlined and discussed in two streams, equilibrium relations and traffic dynamics. Among the topics pertaining to equilibrium relations, the highlighted gaps include the lack of empirical studies on the hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, the existence of multi-modal NMFD (3D-NMFD) in different traffic conditions, the factors that might affect the (3D-) NMFD shape, the accuracy of speed-NMFDs in particular different bus speed NMFDs, and the passenger-oriented NMFDs. Research gaps pertaining to traffic dynamics include the analytical solution of trip-based models, the FIFO violation in the delay-based models, the definition of outflow and entrance functions, the notion of active network length, the trip length distribution, and the path flow distribution. Future research directions targeting topics that might shape the potential next era include the practical implementation of NMFD-based control strategies, the application of NMFD in quality of service assessments, and NMFD in the presence of new technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).},

	abstract = {Well-established fine-scale urban mobility models today depend on detailed but cumbersome and expensive travel surveys for their calibration. Not much is known, however, about the set of mechanisms needed to generate complete mobility profiles if only using passive datasets with mostly sparse traces of individuals. In this study, we present a mechanistic modeling framework (TimeGeo) that effectively generates urban mobility patterns with resolution of 10 min and hundreds of meters. It ties together the inference of home and work activity locations from data, with the modeling of flexible activities (e.g., other) in space and time. The temporal choices are captured by only three features: the weekly home-based tour number, the dwell rate, and the burst rate. These combined generate for each individual: (
              i
              ) stay duration of activities, (
              ii
              ) number of visited locations per day, and (
              iii
              ) daily mobility networks. These parameters capture how an individual deviates from the circadian rhythm of the population, and generate the wide spectrum of empirically observed mobility behaviors. The spatial choices of visited locations are modeled by a rank-based exploration and preferential return (r-EPR) mechanism that incorporates space in the EPR model. Finally, we show that a hierarchical multiplicative cascade method can measure the interaction between land use and generation of trips. In this way, urban structure is directly related to the observed distance of travels. This framework allows us to fully embrace the massive amount of individual data generated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) worldwide to comprehensively model urban mobility without travel surveys.},

We design a simple and intuitive yet effective embedding for locations traces, and use generative adversarial networks to produce data points in this space, which will ﬁnally be transformed back to a sequential location trajectory form. We evaluate our method on realistic location trajectories and compare our synthetic traces with multiple existing methods on how they preserve geographic and semantic features of real traces at both aggregated and individual levels. Our empirical results prove the capability of our generative model in preserving various useful properties of real data.},

These advances, however, come with greater data requirements, and the risk and the substantial cost involved with adoption of these models have slowed their move to operational use. The purpose of this research was twofold. First, the study addressed one aspect of an incremental approach that more carefully balanced the risks and benefits of moving operational models in new directions: replacement of the choice model of home-based work destination in the four-step travel model system with a pair of choice models at the level of the individual worker. The new choice models were implemented as long-term choices in the linked land use model system. Second, the models were used to provide a way to derive matches between workers and their workplace with commonly available data. These matches complemented synthetic populations and provided a key input for activity-based travel models. The models predicted whether a worker would choose to work at home on a long-term basis; if he or she did not, an out-of-home job was chosen. These models linked an individual worker to a specific job at a workplace and therefore directly predicted commuting patterns. The paper presents the model specifications, estimation results, and results of validation of the models against observed commuting data from the Census Transportation Planning Package. The model reproduced observed commuting flows well, and computational performance was fast, even though the model operated at the level of the individual worker and job.},

As a result, many urban entities and states are embarking upon comprehensive freight transportation planning efforts aimed at ensuring safe, efficient, and smooth movement of freight along multimodal and intermodal networks. Over the past few decades there has been considerable published research on (1) freight transportation factors, (2) freight travel demand modeling methods, (3) freight transportation planning issues, and (4) freight data needs, deficiencies, and collection methods. A synthesis of the body of knowledge in these four areas is provided with a view to developing a comprehensive statewide freight transportation planning framework. The proposed framework consists of two interrelated components that facilitate demand estimation and decision making in the freight transportation sector.},

In this paper we briefly describe the agent-based simulation workflow and give the details of our datadriven approach for (1) modeling the road network of Amsterdam metropolitan area extended by major national roads, (2) recreating the car owners population distribution from municipality demographic data, (3) modeling the agent activity based on travel survey, and (4) modeling the inflow and outflow boundary conditions based on the traffic sensor data. The models are implemented in scientific Python and MATSim agent-based freeware. Simulation results of 46.5 thousand agents -with travel plans sampled from the model distributions- show that travel demand model is consistent, but should be improved to correspond with sensor data. The next steps in our project are: extensive validation, calibration and testing of large-scale scenarios, including critical events like the major power outage in the Netherlands (doi:10.1016/j.procs.2015.11.039), and modelling emissions and heat islands caused by traffic jams.},

This paper argues that it is essential to understand why people travel the way they do and not only be able to predict the overall activity patterns accurately. If one cannot understand the ‘‘why?’’ then a model’s ability to evaluate the impact of future interventions is severely diminished. Bayesian networks (BNs) provide the ability to investigate causality and is showing value in recent literature to generate synthetic populations. This paper is novel in extending the application of BNs to daily activity tours. Results show that BNs can synthesise both activity and trip chain structures accurately. It outperforms a frequentist approach and can cater for infrequently observed activity patterns, and patterns unobserved in small sample data. It can also account for temporal variables like activity duration.},

This risk makes its usage outside the telecommunication network incompatible with recent data privacy regulations, hampering its adoption in transportation-related applications. To address this issue, we propose a framework designed only with user-aggregated mobile phone data to synthesise realistic daily individual mobility — Digital Twin Travellers. We explore different strategies built around modified Markov models and an adaption of the Rejection Sampling algorithm to recreate realistic daily schedules and locations. We also define a one-day mobility population score to measure the similarity between the population of generated agents and the real mobile phone user population. Ulti­ mately, we show how with a series of histograms provided by the telecommunication service provider (TSP) it is possible and plausible to disaggregate them into new synthetic and useful individual-level information, building in this way a big data travel demand framework that is designed in accordance with current data privacy regulations.},

	abstract = {Although human trajectory data that are collected passively from location-based services (LBS) are regarded as a substitute for household travel surveys that entail a larger cost, the reality is that the data cannot be utilized directly for transportation planning and policy making without imputing missing qualitative information. Deep learning technologies have been widely used to infer the hidden features of passively collected mobile data. A deep neural network, however, is so deterministic that the probabilistic aspect of activity inference cannot be accommodated. In the present study, a stochastic approach (VAE-HMM) was devised to generate human activity chains by incorporating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). Whereas an original HMM clusters data in the observational space, the proposed approach conducts clustering in a latent space with a smaller dimension. The VAE contributes by both reducing the input dimensionality and by sidestepping the overfit to sample data. The variational inference (VI) method was used to estimate the parameters of VAE-HMM within a Bayesian framework. Data drawn from spatio-temporal, demographic, socio-economic, and individual-specific sources were chosen as input variables to feed the model. The VAE-HMM can be trained in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner.},

However, the extent to which network-level macroscopic traffic models may be ready for practical implementation remains to be ascertained. This paper aims to shed light on this matter by reviewing the 50-year history of macroscopic modeling of urban networks and assessing remaining gaps and opportunities for further development of both theory and applications. To this end, the existing literature’s chronology is mapped onto three eras of development, and the corresponding theories, assumptions, and limitations are outlined and discussed in two streams, equilibrium relations and traffic dynamics. Among the topics pertaining to equilibrium relations, the highlighted gaps include the lack of empirical studies on the hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, the existence of multi-modal NMFD (3D-NMFD) in different traffic conditions, the factors that might affect the (3D-) NMFD shape, the accuracy of speed-NMFDs in particular different bus speed NMFDs, and the passenger-oriented NMFDs. Research gaps pertaining to traffic dynamics include the analytical solution of trip-based models, the FIFO violation in the delay-based models, the definition of outflow and entrance functions, the notion of active network length, the trip length distribution, and the path flow distribution. Future research directions targeting topics that might shape the potential next era include the practical implementation of NMFD-based control strategies, the application of NMFD in quality of service assessments, and NMFD in the presence of new technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).},

	abstract = {Le transport de marchandises en ville (TMV) est essentiel à la vitalité économique des espaces urbains, mais également source de nombreuses externalités négatives, notamment la congestion routière. Si la quantification des pertes de temps est aujourd’hui une pratique banalisée, la contribution du TMV est moins fréquemment étudiée. Par ailleurs, l’impact réciproque de la congestion sur les opérations de TMV est relativement peu abordé, surtout dans une perspective urbanistique et géographique. L’occupation de la voirie par les véhicules de fret et leurs impacts sur l’organisation du TMV peuvent pourtant être considérés comme étant le résultat de divers phénomènes socio-spatiaux.Cette thèse se propose d’analyser l’occupation de la voirie par les véhicules de fret, l’importance des coûts de congestion routière associés ainsi que les incidences sur l’organisation du TMV. D’un point de vue théorique, le TMV est pensé comme un ensemble de processus industriels (à envisager dans un cadre plus large que la simple opération de transport) aux caractéristiques variées, mis en place par des entreprises pour répondre aux besoins d’approvisionnement des entreprises d’une aire urbaine. Nous analysons l’articulation de ces processus industriels avec les formes urbaines de la ville, et en particulier la relation difficile qu’entretiennent le TMV et la densité spatiale. D’un point de vue empirique, nous mobilisons plusieurs sources de données décrivant les flux de marchandises en Ile-de-France (dont l’enquête Transport de Marchandises en Ville (ETMV) réalisée en 2010). Outre son ancrage fort dans un référentiel spatial, nos analyses empiriques de la contribution du TMV à la congestion routière s’inspirent de plusieurs cadres disciplinaires, l’ingénierie des trafics et l’économie des transports notamment},

This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on studies investigating the adoption of green vehicles in urban freight transportation, paying specific attention to e-commerce. To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers); (b) policy (55 papers); (c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption. The use of autonomous vehicles results the most promising and challenging solution for last-mile logistics.},

	abstract = {The growth of e-commerce has increased urban freight transport, bringing negative externalities of emissions, pollution, noise, congestion, and habitat loss. There is a visible effort to make the urban last-mile (LM) deliveries more sustainable, mainly in the environmental aspects; however, the related literature lacks a synthesis of the up-to-date research trends and available solutions. This paper reviews relevant literature following SRL methodology in terms of topics related to green LM deliveries on the e-commerce market in urban areas, and identifies trends and the research gaps in this field. In addition, current research topics and existing solutions within the e-commerce market, which increase its environmental sustainability are presented. The findings provide an accurate and comprehensive synthesis of research in green LM e-commerce deliveries in cities, identify current and emerging interests of researchers worldwide, and discover areas requiring further studies. The topics of ICT and smart solutions, customer behavior, and performance assessment certainly seem to be underestimated in the current research. In practical terms, it is a source of knowledge and guidelines on the current developments regarding the existing solution for the LM e-commerce deliveries in the urban area, which might help local governments, freight operators, and other stakeholders of last-mile logistics to improve their sustainability.},

The objective is to dynamically control a fleet of drivers in a way that avoids delays with respect to customers’ deadlines. There are two sources of uncertainty in the problem. First, the customers are unknown until they place an order. Second, the time at which the food is ready at the restaurant is unknown. To address these challenges, we present an anticipatory customer assignment (ACA) policy. To account for the stochasticity in the problem, ACA postpones the assignment decisions for selected customers, allowing more flexibility in assignments. In addition, ACA introduces a time buffer to reduce making decisions that are likely to result in delays. We also consider bundling, which is the practice of assigning multiple orders at a time to a driver. Based on real-world data, we show how ACA is able to improve service significantly for all stakeholders compared with current practice.},

The demand for delivery services has strongly increased in recent years. Despite the fact that a lot of research is addressing the question of more efficient business models to mitigate the negative implications of delivery services on traffic and environment, little is known about the actual traffic volume generated by delivery services and the drivers of demand. This paper analyzes these topics based on a regression analysis of survey data from four survey conducted in Switzerland and Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic. The applied regression models confirm the results of the descriptive analysis and show the impact of age, gender, income, education and family situation as well as the general shopping behavior on the demand for deliveries. Food orders are often made by younger people without children and lower education levels, while parcels are more often received by younger people with children, higher income and higher education levels. For both food and parcel deliveries, complementary effects between consumer behavior, online and in-store shopping can be observed.},

The model is used to evaluate the transportation and energy impacts of goods movement across urban and national scales. The framework is implemented within POLARIS, a C++-based Planning and Operations Language for Agent-based Regional Integrated Simulation, which consists of an activity-based modeling (ABM) and dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) system that has robust features for passenger travel. This platform provides a tool to model interactions among consumers, producers, and the transportation system. The main objective of this initial implementation is to implement a freight model within POLARIS following an agent-based paradigm with behavioral and simulation methods. This paper presents the initial framework and illustrates the application of the model. Building upon earlier works, a parcel location assignment algorithm for business establishments in the population is documented, along with a method for estimating establishment production and consumption volumes. In addition to population generation, other features of the model include push-pull supply chains, multimodal path choice, choice of transportation logistics node, and dynamic traffic assignment. A module with e-commerce supply and demand was also developed to analyze the effects of e-commerce delivery on last-mile energy use and congestion.},

The resulting travel demand is published for others to use as a comprehensive data basis for agent-based transport simulations and as a test bed for population and demand synthesis algorithms. Furthermore, it is discussed how implicit correlation structures impact the potential use cases of the synthetic travel demand for simulation and analysis purposes and how the common practice of using population samples for downstream simulations affects the results.},

The ride-hailing system is formed of a centrally managed fleet of autonomous electric vehicles which is creating a transformative new technology with significant cost savings. This problem involves a dispatch problem for assigning riders to cars, a surge pricing problem for deciding on the price per trip and a planning problem for deciding on the fleet size. We use approximate dynamic programming to develop high-quality operational dispatch strategies to determine which car is best for a particular trip, when a car should be recharged, when it should be re-positioned to a different zone which offers a higher density of trips and when it should be parked. These decisions have to be made in the presence of a highly dynamic call-in process, and assignments have to take into consideration the spatial and temporal patterns in trip demand which are captured using value functions. We prove that the value functions are monotone in the battery and time dimensions and use hierarchical aggregation to get better estimates of the value functions with a small number of observations. Then, surge pricing is discussed using an adaptive learning approach to decide on the price for each trip. Finally, we discuss the fleet size problem.},

	abstract = {Matching trip requests and available drivers efficiently is considered a central operational problem for ride-hailing services. A widely adopted matching strategy is to accumulate a batch of potential passenger-driver matches and solve bipartite matching problems repeatedly. The efficiency of matching can be improved substantially if the matching is delayed by adaptively adjusting the matching time interval. The optimal delayed matching is subject to the trade-off between the delay penalty and the reduced wait cost and is dependent on the system’s supply and demand states. Searching for the optimal delayed matching policy is challenging, as the current policy is compounded with past actions. To this end, we tailor a family of reinforcement learning-based methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality and sparse reward issues. In addition, this work provides a solution to spatial partitioning balance between the state representation error and the optimality gap of asynchronous matching. Lastly, we examine the proposed methods with real-world taxi trajectory data and garner managerial insights into the general delayed matching policies. The focus of this work is single-ride service due to limited access to shared ride data, while the general framework can be extended to the setting with a ride-pooling component.},

	abstract = {Shared mobility-on-demand systems can improve the efficiency of urban mobility through reduced vehicle ownership and parking demand. However, some issues in their implementations remain open, most notably the issue of rebalancing non-occupied vehicles to meet geographically uneven demand, as is, for example, the case during the rush hour. This is somewhat alleviated by the prospect of autonomous mobility-on-demand systems, where autonomous vehicles can relocate themselves; however, the proposed relocation strategies are still centralized and assume all vehicles are a part of the same fleet. Furthermore, ride-sharing is not considered, which also has an impact on rebalancing, as already occupied vehicles can also potentially be available to serve new requests simultaneously. In this paper we propose a reinforcement learning-based decentralized approach to vehicle relocation as well as ride request assignment in shared mobility-on-demand systems. Each vehicle autonomously learns its behaviour, which includes both rebalancing and selecting which requests to serve, based on its local current and observed historical demand. We evaluate the approach using data on taxi use in New York City, first serving a single request by a vehicle at a time, and then introduce ride-sharing to evaluate its impact on the learnt rebalancing and assignment behaviour.},

	abstract = {In a mobility-on-demand system, travel requests are handled by a fleet of shared vehicles in an on-demand fashion. An important factor that determines the operational efficiency and service level of such a mobility-on-demand system is its operational policy that assigns available vehicles to open passenger requests and relocates idle vehicles. Previously described operational policies are based on control theoretical approaches, most notably on receding horizon control. In this work, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to design an operational policy for a mobility-on-demand system. In particular, we propose a cascaded learning framework to reduce the number of state-action pairs which allows for more efficient learning. We train our model using the AMoDeus simulation environment and real taxi trip travel data from the city of San Francisco. Finally, we demonstrate that our reinforcement learning based operational policy for mobility-on-demand systems outperforms state-of the art fleet operational policies that are based on conventional control theoretical approaches.},

Further, ride-sharing allows sharing costs and, hence, reduces the congestion and emission by making better use of vehicle capacities. In this paper, we develop a distributed model-free, DeepPool, that uses deep Q-network (DQN) techniques to learn optimal dispatch policies by interacting with the environment. Further, DeepPool efficiently incorporates travel demand statistics and deep learning models to manage dispatching vehicles for improved ride sharing services. Using real-world dataset of taxi trip records in New York, DeepPool performs better than other strategies, proposed in the literature, that do not consider ride sharing or do not dispatch the vehicles to regions where the future demand is anticipated. Finally, DeepPool can adapt rapidly to dynamic environments since it is implemented in a distributed manner in which each vehicle solves its own DQN individually without coordination.},

	abstract = {Large-scale agent-based transport models of whole territories have become an important tool in research and planning of new services and policies. Yet, studies based on those tools are rarely reproducible due to the complexity of data sources and modeling processes. One important element towards fully replicable simulations is automatic calibration of behavioral and infrastructural model parameters. The present paper contributes to standardizing the calibration process by describing a consistent framework for benchmarking calibration objectives and optimization algorithms. Furthermore, the paper advances the current state of the art by exploring the integration of a search acceleration method for iterative simulators (opdyts) with sample-based evolutionary search algorithms. In a use case for Paris and the MATSim simulator, we demonstrate the applicability of the framework. We show that opdyts accelerates the parameter search process, although its comparative runtime benefits decrease with higher availability of computational resources.},

The aim is to simulate freight distribution within urban areas for evaluation, control and design of the urban freight transport system. Policy-oriented models help public decision making about the main stakes associated with an urban sustainable development. These models have to simulate the present situation properly enough to provide a good quality forecast to satisfy both local urban and global environmental issues. Data collected in order to calibrate those models have to fit into the methods carried out for their working. So we propose first doing a critical investigation of different possible methodological approaches for urban goods movement surveying. Secondly we present some recent approaches staying more close to reality, stressing on the necessary quality of data to improve the reliability of the results.},

The types of vehicles differ in terms of their capacities, ﬁxed costs and variable costs. The objective is to minimize the total cost, subject to capacity and route duration constraints. We assume customers are distributed over a circular service region partitioned into zones, each of which is serviced by a single vehicle. The routing costs are assessed through a continuous approximation model. We present a mixed integer non-linear formulation for the problem, followed by computationally efﬁcient upper and lower bounding procedures. The performance of the model and of its bounds is assessed on several test instances.},

The current system without consolidation center is compared in terms of operational costs with a future system where a consolidation center is implemented. Continuous analysis is used to formulate a basic model to estimate costs and benefits. Finally, general results are discussed and a case study in L’Hospitalet de Llobregat (Metropolitan Area of Barcelona) is analyzed. Results are promising with a 12-14\% of operational cost savings in a general case. From the case study we conclude that the commitment of the 40\% of demand allows covering the costs of terminal implantation.},

Our UCC modeling approach is focused on continuous analytic models for the general case of carriers with different market shares. Savings are highly sensitive to the design of the system: the increment of capacity in interurban vehicles and the proximity of the UCC terminal to the area in relation to current distribution centers. An exhaustive collection of possible market shares distributions are discussed. Results show that market shares distribution does not affect cost savings significantly. The analysis of the proposed model also highlights the trade-off between savings in the system and a minimum market share per company when the consolidation center is established.},

In this paper, we consider time-window access restrictions based upon the characteristics of the vehicles, and we propose a human-inthe-loop decision support system (HIL-DSS) architecture using optimization and simulation models to address the trade-off between vehicles characteristics, revenues, costs, and performance. We formulate both a deterministic and a stochastic optimization decision model addressing the problem in the context of the HILDSS. In doing this, we emphasize the role of the human decision maker in tackling a complex problem affected by variability and uncertainty, and to overcome the rigidity of optimization models thanks to the possibility to include qualitative information into the process.},

Although the push towards digitalization and processes interconnection can bring substantial beneﬁts, it may also increase the complexity of processes in terms of integration and management. To fully exploit the potential of technology, companies are required to develop an in-depth knowledge of each operational activity and related human aspects in the contexts where technology solutions can be implemented. Indeed, analyzing the impacts of technology on human work is key to promoting human-centred smart manufacturing and logistics processes. Therefore, this paper aims at increasing and systematizing knowledge about technologies supporting internal logistics working activities The main contribution of this paper is a taxonomy of the technologies that may be implemented in the different internal logistics areas to support a Logistics 4.0 model. Such a contribution is elaborated in accordance with a deductive approach (i.e., reasoning from the particular to the general), and backed up by an analysis of the literature. The taxonomy represents a useful framework to understand the current and possible technological implementations to drive logistics processes towards Logistics 4.0, with speciﬁc attention to the relation between human operators and technologies.},

	title = {A {Systematic} {Review} of {Innovative} {Technologies} adopted in {Logistics} {Management}},
	abstract = {Logistics and supply chain management have always been at the forefront of industrial innovations, and numerous technologies have been tested and applied with success to increase efficiency of processes, reduce costs, or improve the relationships among different actors, such as buyers, sellers, retailers and carriers. In recent times, there is a great debate in both practitioners and academic’ worlds about the impacts of these new technologies on the traditional logistic operations. The perspective of extant literature on technology adoption in logistics is quite fragmented: in fact, a stream of literature studies how a technology might provide improvements in logistics processes (e.g. warehouse management, goods distribution) and/or logistics management objectives (e.g. warehouse efficiency), while other research works focus on the impact of technology adoption in terms of overall business performance. Moreover, despite the amount of articles, reports and news regarding innovations in logistics, one of the last literature review about existing technologies applied in logistics has been published almost ten years ago and it is limited only to ICT technologies. Therefore, we reckon the need for an updated view on the literature in this field. Through a systematic literature review, we try to give an answer to the following research questions: i) how the interest in this topic changed in the last ten years from the point of view of scientific literature; ii) what are the main approaches and methodologies used in addressing this issue; iii) what are the most applied innovative technologies in the logistics field.},

An intermodal fleet planning framework with a classification scheme is also proposed by considering different problem/modeling characteristics, decision-making levels and multiple players or decision makers. Majority of the papers in this field generally focused on single mode fleet planning problems from the viewpoint of a single decision maker. However, there is a limited number of studies on intermodal fleet planning with multiple transport modes and resources. On the other hand, there is a strong interaction among the fleet planning components such as fleet sizing/composition, fleet deployment, fleet inventory control, empty vehicle repositioning problems etc. Nevertheless, these problems are mostly modeled and solved in a separated way in the available literature. Evaluation of the previous fleet planning researches enabled us to identify gaps in the literature and comment on the directions for future works which can lead to develop expert systems/decision support systems in the context of Logistics 4.0 for the integrated fleet planning problems with sustainability objectives under uncertain environments.},

	abstract = {Due to new regulations and further technological progress in the field of electric vehicles, the research community faces the new challenge of incorporating the electric energy based restrictions into vehicle routing problems. One of these restrictions is the limited battery capacity which makes detours to recharging stations necessary, thus requiring efficient tour planning mechanisms in order to sustain the competitiveness of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles. We introduce the Electric Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Recharging Stations (E-FSMFTW) to model decisions to be made with regards to fleet composition and the actual vehicle routes including the choice of recharging times and locations. The available vehicle types differ in their transport capacity, battery size and acquisition cost. Furthermore, we consider time windows at customer locations, which is a common and important constraint in real-world routing and planning problems. We solve this problem by means of branch-and-price as well as proposing a hybrid heuristic, which combines an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search with an embedded local search and labeling procedure for intensification. By solving a newly created set of benchmark instances for the E-FSMFTW and the existing single vehicle type benchmark using an exact method as well, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this study, we systematically assess three aspects of the net impacts of TNCs on urban mobility in the United States—road congestion, transit ridership and private vehicle ownership—and examine how these impacts have evolved over time. Based on a set of fixed-effect panel models estimated using metropolitan statistical area level data, we find that the entrance of TNCs led to increased road congestion in terms of both intensity (by 0.9\%) and duration (by 4.5\%), an 8.9\% decline in transit ridership and an insignificant change in vehicle ownership. Despite the ideal of providing a sustainable mobility solution by promoting large-scale car sharing, our analysis suggests that TNCs have intensified urban transport challenges since their debut in the United States.},

Superblock design reduces space assigned to cars to enable alternative uses for improving liveability and sustainability. Here, the potential for superblock transformation is systematically quantified and evaluated for cities with varying urban forms and densities. A superblock consists of nine (3 × 3) urban city blocks, including interior and exterior streets. Miniblocks, consisting of four (2 × 2) blocks, are proposed as a less-disruptive strategy to initiate urban transformation on which superblocks can build. A geospatial network-based approach is developed to find locations for introducing multifunctional streets. For possible site prioritization, the identified locations are evaluated concerning the potential disruption to traffic. The analysis reveals that the potential for superblocks and miniblocks, as well as their disruption effect, varies considerably across cities and is affected by the urban layout. For some cities, over 40\% of the street network is potentially suitable for integrating superblock or miniblock design, providing opportunities for city-scale transition towards more sustainable and liveable cities. A grid-like layout in cities is not a sufficient condition for high superblock potential, and cities with irregular street layouts can show high transformation potential as well.},

Instead of following the traditional route-based travel time estimation, we propose to simply use a large amount of taxi trips without using the intermediate trajectory points to estimate the travel time between source and destination. Our experiments show very promising results. The proposed big-data-driven approach significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art route-based method and online map services.

This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on studies investigating the adoption of green vehicles in urban freight transportation, paying specific attention to e-commerce. To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers); (b) policy (55 papers); (c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption. The use of autonomous vehicles results the most promising and challenging solution for last-mile logistics.},

	abstract = {Freight vehicle tours and tour-chains are essential elements of state-the-art agent-based urban freight simulations as well as key units to analyse freight vehicle demand. GPS traces are typically used to extract vehicle tours and tour-chains and became available in a large scale to, for example, fleet management firms. While methods to process this data with the objective of analysing and modelling tour-based freight vehicle operations have been proposed, they were not fully explored with regard to the implication of underlying assumptions. In this context, we test different algorithms of stop-to-tour assignment, tour-type and tour-chain identification, aiming to expose their implications. Specifically, we compare the traditional stopto-tour assignment algorithm using the location of a “base” as the start/end point of tours, against other algorithms using stop activities or payload capacity usage. Furthermore, we explore high-resolution tour-type/chain identification algorithms, considering stop types and recurrence of visits. For tour-chain identification, we explore two algorithms: one defines the day-level tour-chain-type based on the predominant tour-type identified for the period of 1 day and another defines the tourchain-type based on the average number of stops per tour by stop type. For a demonstration purpose, we apply the methods to data from a large-scale GPS-based survey conducted during 2017–2019 in Singapore. We compare the algorithms in an assessment of freight vehicle operations day-to-day pattern homogeneity. Our analysis demonstrates that the predictions of tours, tourtypes, and tour-chain-types are highly dependent on the assumptions used, underlining the importance of carefully selecting and disclosing the methods for data processing. Finally, the exploration of day-to-day pattern homogeneity reveals operational differences across vehicle types and industries.},

	abstract = {Freight forecasting models have been significantly improved in recent years, especially in the field of goods vehicle behavior modeling. On the other hand, the improvements to commodity flow modeling, which provide inputs for goods vehicle simulations, were limited. Contributing to this component in urban freight modeling systems, we propose an error component logit mixture model for matching a receiver to a supplier that considers two-layers in supplier selection: distribution channels and specific suppliers. The distribution channel is an important element in freight modeling, as the type of distribution channel is relevant to various aspects of shipments and vehicle trips. The model is estimated using the data from the Tokyo Metropolitan Freight Survey. We demonstrate how typical establishment survey data (i.e. establishment and outbound shipment records) can be used to develop the model. The model captures the correlation structure of potential suppliers defined by business function and provides insights on the differences in the supplier choice by distribution channel. The reproducibility tests confirm the validity of the proposed approach, which is currently integrated into a metropolitan-scale agent-based freight modeling system, for practical use.},

We estimate spatial lag models using population, employment, or establishment transportation accessibilities as explanatory variables and network-based truck traffic as the dependent variable, modifying the approach used in the Los Angeles study. We identify differences in the characteristics of the variables and the models between the Los Angeles and Paris cases, each having a distinctively different urban structure. While the models estimated for the Paris region provide beneficial insights into the relationships between freight landscape indicators and urban freight traffic, the complex correlation structure among indicators, as well as the limitation of the models for specifying the areas of very high truck traffic, underlines the need for further research on the modeling framework and for more case studies.},

The estimated coefficients are also compared against their theoretical values derived from a conceptual economic order quantity model. The estimated empirical models highlight the characteristics of intra-city shipments and indicate the importance of both receiver function and commodity type, and also vehicle operation type, in capturing the nuances of the selection mechanism among intra-city shipments.},

The adaptation of freight models to the urban environment strongly relies on an eﬃcient unit of observation, which is introduced as the spine of the model after discussing the main approaches of urban freight transport modelling. The main features of the model are then presented from the generation to the distribution of freight operations and are confronted to elements of validation. The robustness of the model is also discussed through time by analysing elements of its initial calibration 20 years ago and the latest results of urban freight surveys in order to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. We show that the model is able to summarize eﬃciently the urban freight transport phenomenon and is still statistically robust twenty years after its ﬁrst design although it needs marginal adaptations on organisational elements.},

The framework is developed by combining elements of over a dozen existing frameworks from the supply chain management literature. Based on this comprehensive framework, we review freight modelling approaches from the literature. We find that freight modelling can be extended by taking into account previously uncovered areas of logistics decisions, such as those related to marketing or logistics systems forecasting and planning, as well as in areas that are well known from an optimization perspective but not from a descriptive perspective, such as routing and scheduling decisions. We conclude with a systematic listing of such areas, which can be used by researchers and transport modelling practitioners to develop further those transport models that take agent decision making as a starting point.},

	abstract = {Freight transportation has major economic, energy, and sustainability impacts. As a result, forecasting tools for analyzing policy scenarios are critical. However, existing freight transportation modeling tools have major gaps, especially in agent representation, prediction of fleet and distribution center control, and strategic alignment of agent decisions. We address these gaps by developing a new architecture for freight transportation modeling called CRISTAL: Collaborative, Informed, Strategic Trade Agents with Logistics. CRISTAL is an agent-based model that includes both firms and establishments (establishments are members of firms). Agents collaborate to form supply chain partnerships in trade and logistics. An Effect of Information captures information sharing in the supply chain, providing a mechanism to operationalize the push–pull boundary, which occurs at the customer-order decoupling point. Agents form strategies then align subsequent decisions with these strategies. Our CRISTAL implementation is multi-resolution, with urban freight linked to national and global supply chains. It is integrated with passenger activity, including household e-commerce use and passenger traffic. The frame­ work has been applied to study e-commerce and truck traffic. This paper summarizes the conceptual model, its initial implementation, and applications to date.},

This paper proposes a statistical approach to estimate truck activities and freight analytics from Global Positioning System (GPS) data of trucks. Commodities carried are also determined by the locations and types of truck stops. With the estimated activities and commodities carried, the characteristics of trip chains for different commodities are then determined and analysed. An empirical example from Thailand is adopted to illustrate the proposed approaches in estimating activities, activity patterns, commodity trip chains and status of trips legs from the collected truck GPS data.},

	abstract = {Calibration is an essential process in making an agent-based simulator operational. In particular, the calibration for freight demand is challenging because of the model complexity and the shortage of available freight demand data compared with passenger data. This paper proposes a novel calibration method that relies solely on screenline counts, named screenline-based two-step calibration (SLTC). SLTC consists of two parts: (1) tour-based demand adjustment; and (2) model parameter updates. The former generates screenline-based tours by cloning/removing instances of the simulated goods vehicle tours, aiming to minimize the gaps between the observed and the simulated screenline counts. The latter updates the parameters of the commodity flow model which generates inputs to simulate goods vehicle tours. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method, we apply it to an agent-based urban freight simulator, SimMobility Freight. The result shows that SLTC allows the simulator to replicate the observed screenline counts with reasonable computational cost for calibration.},

Consequently, freight stakeholders remain unaware of collaboration oppor­ tunities and the potential benefit of those coalitions. This paper focuses on implementing collaboration between urban freight receivers and carriers. Collaboration takes the form of cost-sharing among coalition members when receivers are willing to extend their time windows. Rigorous experiments confirm the behavioural sensitivity of the model. A realistically-sized case study in the City of Cape Town, South Africa, demonstrates the usability of the agent-based simulation model. The case study considers the impact of collaboration on after-hour deliveries. Results indicate that delivery cost reduces significantly (nearly 30\%) when carriers and receivers are willing to collaborate and adopt after-hour deliveries - the carrier’s fleet composition changes to favour fewer but larger vehicles.},

	abstract = {The research germinates from the statement that the cities have to solve the impacts due to freight transport in order to improve their sustainability implementing sets of city logistics measures. But city logistics measures involve several actors and choice dimensions. It is therefore important to have methods and models able to assess the effectiveness of the measures to be implemented. The current models were mainly developed to simulate some aspects of urban freight transport, and are not able to forecast many impacts of implementing traffic and transportation measures at an urban scale. This paper presents a modelling approach that tries to point out the relations existing among city logistics measures, actors and choice dimensions. It comprises three model sub-systems to estimate the quantity O–D matrices by transport service type (e.g. retailer on own account or wholesaler on own account or by carrier), the delivery O–D matrices by delivery time period, and the vehicle O–D matrices according to delivery tour departure time and vehicle type. This modelling system is a multi-stage model and considers a discrete choice approach for each decisional level. It was first tested using some data collected in the inner area of Rome, including traffic counts and interviews with retailers and truck-drivers. The model estimations were also compared with the experimental ones, and quite satisfactory results were obtained.},

The holistic approach evaluates technical feasibility, system cost, energy demand, transportation time, and sustainability-related impacts of various decarbonization strategies. In contrast to previous work, the consequences of a transformation to fully decarbonized transport system scenarios are quantiﬁed across all trafﬁc segments, considering procurement, operation, and disposal. The methodology can be applied to arbitrary regions and transport systems. Here, the metropolitan region of Berlin is chosen as a demonstration case. The ﬁrst results are shown for a complete conversion of all trafﬁc segments from conventional propulsion technology to battery electric vehicles. The transition of private individual trafﬁc is analyzed regarding technical feasibility, energy demand and environmental impact. Commercial goods, municipal trafﬁc and public transport are analyzed with respect to system cost and environmental impacts. We can show a feasible transition path for all cases with substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions. Based on current technologies and today’s cost structures our simulation shows a moderate increase in total systems cost of 13–18\%.},

Further trend is the increasing share of e-commerce activities of private households. This results in a higher share of flexible and more small-scaled deliveries. Consequently, an increased share of trips of small and medium sized freight vehicles has been observed and is expected in urban areas. These development drivers of urban freight transport can be investigated by this present methodological approach. Therefore, an approach of a System Dynamics (SD) model linked with a microscopic freight transport simulation is shown in this contribution.

	abstract = {Freight is transported by the use of different cargo types to increase efficiency. However, multimodal freight transport research does not include different commonly used cargo types in its analyses. The literature has illustrated that the cargo types used affects transport, storage and transshipment costs, and consequently cost-based decision making in the supply chain. Moreover, from a practical point of view, it can be seen that local market players have begun to successfully shift new cargo types to rail and inland waterways. This research presents the incorporation of five different commonly used cargo types into an agent-based freight transport model for Belgium. The MATSim freight extension is extended by considering the cargo type used and by adding mode choice to the optimization process. The results demonstrate that the potential for a modal shift varies greatly between the considered cargo types. Solid bulk, liquid bulk and containers show the highest shares for rail and inland waterway transport (35,8\%, 48,9\% and 29,6\% respectively). Moreover, the sensitivity of the modal split towards changes in the transport costs of road transport (+10\%) differs according to the cargo type used. Containers are not very sensitive (+1,2\%), while pallets (+2,4\%), solid bulk (+3,9\%) and liquid bulk (+5,9\%) show higher increases. Consequently, some cargo types are more favorable for a modal shift than other cargo types. Tthe idea of considering the cargo type as a variable that affects the modal choice is new.},

Results indicate that the carrier's delivery cost reduced by up to 12.1\% when more receivers were willing to accept off-hour deliveries. This reduction was facilitated by the ability of the carrier to use more extralarge delivery vehicles and better utilise the capacity of its vehicles during deliveries, decreasing its delivery cost per tonne. In addition, it was found that the majority of grand coalition receivers were willing to accept off-hour deliveries when carrier cost savings were transferred to them.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that micro-simulation and agent-based approaches can successfully be applied in transport policy analysis. However, logistic decisions and the complex relationships among freight actors make this a challenging task and a reason why the development of freight models is still behind the development of passenger models. In this paper, we present a multi-agent freight transport model in which logistics decisions are separated into two different roles: Transport service providers, which create transport chains, and carriers, which plan tours and schedule vehicles. Both agent types can consolidate on their respective level and realise economies of scale. The lowest tier of the model, which contains individual freight vehicles, is integrated into the MATSim traffic simulation to create an integrated model for freight and passenger traffic. Changes in passenger demand, disturbances in the traffic system or policy measures can be picked up by freight drivers and propagated upwards to influence decisions on the levels of vehicle scheduling and transport chain building. As proof of concept, we set up a scenario with a fictitious freight operator serving a set of customers. We demonstrate that freight traffic can be simulated under different traffic conditions and policy measures.},

	abstract = {Freight forecasting is essential for managing, planning operating and optimizing the use of resources. Multiple market factors contribute to the highly variable nature of freight flows, which calls for adaptive and responsive forecasting models. This paper presents a demand forecasting methodology that supports freight operation planning over short to long term horizons. The method combines time series models and machine learning algorithms in a Reinforcement Learning framework applied over a rolling horizon. The objective is to develop an efficient method that reduces the prediction error by taking full advantage of the traditional time series models and machine learning models. In a case study applied to container shipment data for a US intermodal company, the approach succeeded in reducing the forecast error margin. It also allowed predictions to closely follow recent trends and fluctuations in the market while minimizing the need for user intervention. The results indicate that the proposed approach is an effective method to predict freight demand. In addition to clustering and Reinforcement Learning, a method for converting monthly forecasts to long-term weekly forecasts was developed and tested. The results suggest that these monthly-to-weekly long-term forecasts outperform the direct long term forecasts generated through typical time series approaches.},

Four models are integrated: (1) a gravity model for trip distribution, (2) a binary logit model for mode choice, (3) a Noortman and Van Es’ model for truck, and (4) a Noortman and Van Es’ model for rail empty trips. The esti­ mation process entails an iterative minimization of a nonconvex objective function, the sum­ mation of squared errors of the estimated truck and rail traffic counts with respect to the five model parameters. Of the two methods tested to address the nonconvexity, an interior point method with a set of random starting points (Multi-Start algorithm) outperformed the Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) inference technique. The potential of this methodology is examined using a hypothetical example of developing a nationwide freight demand model for Bangladesh. This research improves the existing FODS techniques that use readily available secondary data such as traffic counts and link costs, allowing transportation planners to evaluate policy outcomes without needing expensive freight data collection. This paper presents the results, model vali­ dation, limitations, and future scope for improvements.},

By reviewing the complete process of its construction, starting with the identification of urban policy needs, the relevant survey and databases construction methods, the modelling allowing the simulation of the effects of governance, we illustrate through the French case what are the elements of success for such a scientific endeavour. The adaptation of freight models to the urban environment strongly relies on an efficient unit of observation, which is introduced as the spine of the model after discussing the main approaches of urban freight transport modelling. The main features of the model are then presented from the generation to the distribution of freight operations and are confronted to elements of validation. The robustness of the model is also discussed through time by analysing elements of its initial calibration 20 years ago and the latest results of urban freight surveys in order to highlight its strengths and weaknesses. We show that the model is able to summarize efficiently the urban freight transport phenomenon and is still statistically robust twenty years after its first design although it needs marginal adaptations on organisational elements.},

We find that while urban road freight represents only 6\% of trips and 8\% of distances traveled by road in the Paris region, it accounts for 36\% of total damages caused by pollutant emissions from road traffic. This is the combined result of light and heavy goods vehicles emitting more than private cars, and of freight traffic being more spatially concentrated (within the city center) than passenger traffic, thereby affecting more population. All in all, the environmental cost of urban road freight is around 2.1 billion € per year. Some policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {When I use a word, it means whatever I want it to mean”: Humpty Dumpty in Alice’s Adventures Through The Looking Glass, Lewis Carroll. “Digital twin” is currently a term applied in a wide variety of ways. Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach.},

Yet, studies based on those tools are rarely reproducible due to the complexity of data sources and modeling processes. One important element towards fully replicable simulations is automatic calibration of behavioral and infrastructural model parameters. The present paper contributes to standardizing the calibration process by describing a consistent framework for benchmarking calibration objectives and optimization algorithms. Furthermore, the paper advances the current state of the art by exploring the integration of a search acceleration method for iterative simulators (opdyts) with sample-based evolutionary search algorithms. In a use case for Paris and the MATSim simulator, we demonstrate the applicability of the framework. We show that opdyts accelerates the parameter search process, although its comparative runtime benefits decrease with higher availability of computational resources.},

In the field of population synthesis, current demand models lack dynamic consistency and often fail to capture the angle of activity choices at different times of the day. This article presents a method for synthetic population generation with a focus on activity-time choice. Activity-time choice consists mainly in the activity’s starting time and its duration, and we consider daily planning with some mandatory home-based activity: the chain of other subsequent activities a traveler can participate in depends on their possible end-time and duration as well as the travel distance from one another and opening hours of commodities. We are interested in a suburban area with sparse data available on population, where a discrete choice model based on utilities cannot be implemented due to the lack of microeconomic data. Our method applies activity-hours distributions extracted from the public census, with a limited corpus, to draw the time of a potential next activity based on the end-time of the previous one, predicted travel times, and the successor activities the agent wants to participate in during the day. We show that our method is able to construct plannings for 126k agents over five municipalities, with chains of activity made of work, education, shopping, leisure, restaurant and kindergarten, which fit adequately real-world time distributions.},

In this work we present a method for dynamic vehicle routing that leverages historical data to improve the performance of a network of self-driving taxis. In particular, we describe a constrained optimization method capable of assigning requests to autonomous vehicles in an informed way, to minimize the expected cost of serving both current and future travel requests. We allow several passengers with independent trips to share a vehicle and allow vehicles to pick additional passengers as they progress through their route. Based on historical data, we compute a probability distribution over future demand. Then, samples from the learned probability distribution are incorporated into a decoupled vehicle routing and passenger assignment method to take into account the predicted future demand. This method consists of three steps, namely pruning of feasible trips, assignment of trips to vehicles and rebalancing of idle vehicles. We show the benefits and trade-offs of this predictive approach in an experimental evaluation with over three million rides extracted from a dataset of taxi trips in New York City. Our method produces routes and assignments that, in expectation, reduce the travel and waiting times for passengers, with respect to a purely reactive approach.

	abstract = {On-demand mobility has existed for more than 100 years in the form of taxi systems. Comparatively recently, ride-hailing schemes have also grown to a significant mode share. Most types of such one-way mobility-on-demand systems allow drivers taking independent decisions. These systems are not or only partially coordinated. In a different operating mode, all decisions are coordinated by the operator, allowing for the optimization of certain metrics. Such a coordinated operation is also implied if human-driven vehicles are replaced by self-driving cars. This work quantifies the service quality and efficiency improvements resulting from the coordination of taxi fleets. Results based on high-fidelity transportation simulations and data sets of existing taxi systems are presented for the cities of San Francisco, Chicago, and Zurich. They show that fleet coordination can strongly improve the efficiency and service level of existing systems. Depending on the operator and the city’s preferences, empty vehicle distance driven and fleet sizes could be substantially reduced, or the wait times could be reduced while maintaining the current fleet sizes. The study provides clear evidence that full fleet coordination should be implemented in existing mobility-on-demand systems, even before the availability of self-driving cars.},

	abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization topics, due to its practical importance and methodological interest. Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies are hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution methods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is becoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care for details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the opportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple – open-source – implementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm uses the same general methodology as Vidal et al. (2012) but also includes additional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade of research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP* which consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an insertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of SWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches. Moreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches on the classical instances of Uchoa et al. (2017), HGS still stands as a leading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and conceptual simplicity.},

Commonalities and differences to continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are analyzed. The aspects of reliability of the estimation, overall step size control, and independence from the coordinate system (invariance) become particularly important in small populations sizes. Consequently, performing the adaptation task with small populations is more intricate.},

While its efficiency and accuracy are superior to the well-known cell transmission model, applications of its current numerical formulations are limited by the inability to apply changes to the fundamental diagrams of links within a simulation and the need to start the simulation with an empty network. We resolve both limitations by developing a methodology for initialising the discrete-time link model with a non-empty initial condition and for computing within-link densities during the simulation, which can then serve as an initial condition for continued simulation with a new fundamental diagram. Since the computation of within-link densities is algebraic, no new numerical errors are introduced. Optional support for multiple commodities, subcritical delays and platoon dispersion, are retained. The resulting model is demonstrated on a motorway corridor network with variable speed limits and dynamic lane management.},

The resulting strategy is able to approach the boundary of the feasible region without being impeded in its ability to search in directions tangential to the boundaries. The approach is implemented in the (1 + 1)-CMA-ES and evaluated numerically on several test problems. The results compare very favourably with data for other constraint handling approaches applied to unimodal test problems that can be found in the literature.},

	abstract = {In rural areas with low population density, demand-responsive transport (DRT) is considered a promising alternative to conventional public transport (PT). With a fleet of smaller vehicles, DRT provides a much more flexible and convenient service. This characteristic makes DRT also a potential mode of transport to serve students in rural areas. If DRT vehicles are used to serve students, then the funding for conventional school buses (or adapted public transport schedules) can be reinvested in the DRT system. This may help to relieve the financial burden experienced by DRT operators and enable the operation of a large-scale DRT service in rural areas. In this study, a demand model for school commutes based on real-world, open-source data for Landkreis Vulkaneifel, a rural region in Germany, is built. Then a feasibility study is carried out using an agent-based transport simulation framework. In the feasibility study, various setups and operational schemes are explored, which are followed by a systematic cost analysis. Based on a conservative estimation, an annual budget of around 1600 Euro per student will be needed to maintain and operate a fleet of DRT vehicles that can transport all the students in the region from home to school on time in the morning. During the remaining time of the day and on school holidays, the vehicles can be used for conventional DRT service for the public.},

	abstract = {The market entrance of shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) may have disruptive effects on current transport systems and may lead to their total transformation. For many small and medium-sized cities, a full replacement of public transport services by these systems seems to be possible. For a transport system operator, such a system requires a bigger fleet of vehicles than before, however, vehicles are less expensive and fewer staff is needed for the actual operation. In this paper, we are using a simulation-based approach to evaluate the service quality and operating cost of a demand responsive transit (DRT) system for the city of Cottbus (100 000 inhabitants), Germany. The simulation model used is based on an existing MATSim model of the region that depicts a typical work day. Results suggest, that the current public transport system may be replaced by a system of 300 to 400 DRT vehicles, depending on their operational mode. Compared to previous, schedule based public transport, passengers do not need to transfer, and their overall travel times may be reduced significantly. Results for the cost comparison are preliminary, but results suggest that an autonomous DRT system is not necessarily more expensive than the current public transport system.},

	abstract = {Activity-based models offer the potential of a far deeper understanding of daily mobility behaviour than trip-based models. However, activity-based models used both in research and practice have often relied on applying sequential choice models between subsequent choices, oversimplifying the scheduling process. In this paper we introduce OASIS, an integrated framework to simulate activity schedules by considering all choice dimensions simultaneously. We present a methodology for the estimation of the parameters of an activity-based model from historic data, allowing for the generation of realistic and consistent daily mobility schedules. The estimation process has two main elements: (i) choice set generation, using the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, and (ii) estimation of the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters. We test our approach by estimating parameters of multiple utility specifications for a sample of individuals from a Swiss nationwide travel survey, and evaluating the output of the OASIS model against realised schedules from the data. The results demonstrate the ability of the new framework to simulate realistic distributions of activity schedules, and estimate stable and significant parameters from historic data that are consistent with behavioural theory. This work opens the way for future developments of activity-based models, where a great deal of constraints can be explicitly included in the modelling framework, and all choice dimensions are handled simultaneously.},

	abstract = {For the simulation of public transport, next to a schedule, knowledge of the public transport routes is required. While the schedules are becoming available, the precise network routes often remain unknown and must be reconstructed. For large-scale networks, however, a manual reconstruction becomes unfeasible. This paper presents a route reconstruction algorithm, which requires only the sequence and positions of the public transport stops and the street network. It uses an abstract graph to calculate the least-cost path from a route’s first to its last stop, with the constraint that the path must contain a so-called link candidate for every stop of the route’s stop sequence. The proposed algorithm is implemented explicitly for large-scale, real life networks. The algorithm is able to handle multiple lines and modes, to combine them at the same stop location (e.g., train and bus lines coming together at a train station), to automatically reconstruct missing links in the network, and to provide intelligent and efficient feedback if apparent errors occur. GPS or OSM tracks of the lines can be used to improve results, if available. The open-source algorithm has been tested for Zurich for mapping accuracy. In summary, the new algorithm and its MATSim-based implementation is a powerful, tested tool to reconstruct public transport network routes for large-scale systems.},

	abstract = {Populations in cities are constantly increasing, which puts more stress on existing transportation systems and especially public transport lines. A good example of this is the situation in the Île-de-France (IdF) region around Paris. There, the Grand Paris Express (GPE), a new system of major rail-based public transport lines, is planned to be introduced to complement the existing offer by connecting the suburban areas of Paris without having to go through the center of the capital city. These new lines are expected to be put in service progressively from 2024 to 2030. Along with additional tram-based lines, they are expected to significantly reduce travel time for some parts of the population. In this work, we adopt an agent-based simulation approach in which a synthetic population of IdF with activity chains of is generated. The population is then fed to the simulation with the currently existing public transportation offer as well as the future lines that we consider. The impact of the new offer is evaluated on a subset of the IdF area. We find that future rail-based public transport lines will not only impact existing rail lines but also majorly impact the bus lines which are rendered less attractive in comparison. However, ridership of certain bus lines is greatly increased. Moreover, we assess the potential of using a Mobility-on-Demand feeder service to increase accessibility to rail-based modes. Results show that such a service increases the ridership of related transport lines, while bus trips are decreased. We measure the performance of the Mobility-on-Demand system under different fleet settings. This research is fully reproducible as we solely make use of fully open data, tools and methodologies. We identify development pathways that will be investigated further in future works for a more comprehensive assessment of future transportation systems in IdF.},

The intersection of agents, modeling, simulation, and application domains has been the subject of active research for over two decades. Although agents and simulation have been used effectively in a variety of application domains, much of the supporting research remains scattered in the literature, too often leaving scientists to develop multi-agent system (MAS) models and simulations from scratch.

	abstract = {The technological development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) challenges their economic relevancy. Are AVs worth it? We adapted the cost–benefit analysis framework to the case of AV services. The appraisal methodology was applied to the introduction of an on-demand AV service in Berlin, simulated through MATSim, an agent-based model. The introduction of AVs in a dense urban environment would generate more pressure on the road network. This would cause private car users to experience longer travel times, resulting in a consumer surplus loss that would not offset the new AV users’ benefits. In one configuration, a stop-based routing service appeared to generate fewer externalities (e.g., congestion, emissions, accidents) and would be cheaper to operate than door-to-door routing. Another configuration assumed that private cars were banned. In that case, the consumer surplus significantly decreased, AV services were not able to absorb the entire demand, and the shares of other modes increased. However, the externalities were significantly reduced. Finally, in an urban environment where on-demand AVs were added to the available modes, the social impact was negative for all economic agents, with heterogeneity apparent on the impacts of the different externalities. This would benefit some travelers but would also involve additional congestion. In that case, a stop-based routing seemed preferable (but still negative) to a door-to-door one. Further works discussing the introduction of AVs into an urban environment should focus on line-based options such as automated bus services.},

	abstract = {Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have been studied through analytical dispatch methods and simulation. A common question of interest is how many customers can be served per SAV, which necessarily depends on the network characteristics, travel demand, and dispatch policy. We identify equations that describe the maximum set of demands that could be served if an appropriate dispatch policy were chosen. We then provide a dispatch policy that achieves the predicted level of passenger throughput. This is achieved for a general class of SAV behaviors which may include ridesharing, electric SAV recharging, integration with public transit, or combinations thereof. We accomplish this by defining a Markov chain queueing model which admits general SAV behaviors. We say the network is stable if the head-of-line waiting times remain bounded, which is equivalent to serving all customers at the same rate at which they request service. We give equations characterizing the stable region Λ — the set of demands that could be served by any dispatch policy. We prove that any demand outside Λ cannot be completely served. We further prove that our dispatch policy stabilizes the network for any demand in the stable region using Lyapunov drift, establishing Λ as the maximum set of demand that can be served. Numerical results validate our calculations using simulation, and we present initial results on calculating Λ for a large city network.},

This review covers several aspects of smart card data use in the public transit context. First, the technologies are presented: the hardware and information systems required to operate these tools; and privacy concerns and legal issues related to the dissemination of smart card data, data storage, and encryption are addressed. Then, the various uses of the data at three levels of management are described: strategic (long-term planning), tactical (service adjustments and network development), and operational (ridership statistics and performance indicators). Also reported are smart card commercialization experiments conducted all over the world. Finally, the most promising research avenues for smart card data in this field are presented; for example, comparison of planned and implemented schedules, systematic schedule adjustments, and the survival models applied to ridership.},

	abstract = {Massive and passive data such as cell phone traces provide samples of the whereabouts and movements of individuals. These are a potential source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are sparsely sampled in time, which requires a precise set of techniques for mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by analyzing relational signatures of activity time, duration, and land use. First, we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second, we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies between activity type, trip scheduling, and land use types via a Relational Markov Network. We apply the method to two different kinds of mobile phone datasets from the metropolitan areas of Vienna, Austria and Boston, USA. The former data includes information from mobility management signals, while the latter are usual Call Detail Records. The resulting trip sequence patterns and activity scheduling from both datasets agree well with their respective city surveys, and we show that the inferred activity clusters are stable across different days and both cities. This method to infer activity patterns from cell phone data allows us to use these as a novel and cheaper data source for activity-based modeling and travel behavior studies.},

Since travel diaries, a traditional source to create the transport demand in agent-based transport models, are often hard to procure and not policy-sensitive, alternative approaches to creating travel demand representations for simulation scenarios are sought. In this study, a particularly efficient approach based on Big Data and a new, aspatial activity-based demand model with comparatively low input data requirements is established. Home, work, and education locations are informed based on mobile-phone-based origin-destination matrices. Other activity locations are modeled within the scope of the coevolutionary algorithm of the agent-based transport model, which is also responsible for finding suitable travel options of the modeled individuals. As a result, a comparatively lightweight process chain to create an agent-based transport simulation scenario is established, which is transferable to other regions. A basic quality evaluation of the created tool chain is carried out against a well-validated transport simulation model of the same region.},

This risk makes its usage outside the telecommunication network incompatible with recent data privacy regulations, hampering its adoption in transportation-related applications. To address this issue, we propose a framework designed only with user-aggregated mobile phone data to synthesise realistic daily individual mobility — Digital Twin Travellers. We explore different strategies built around modified Markov models and an adaption of the Rejection Sampling algorithm to recreate realistic daily schedules and locations. We also define a one-day mobility population score to measure the similarity between the population of generated agents and the real mobile phone user population. Ultimately, we show how with a series of histograms provided by the telecommunication service provider (TSP) it is possible and plausible to disaggregate them into new synthetic and useful individual-level information, building in this way a big data travel demand framework that is designed in accordance with current data privacy regulations.},

The model considers the total costs and the environmental impacts of alternative UCC configurations and policy scenarios. According to the results, combinations of regulations and subsidies addressing both traffic inbound and outbound the facilities could be the most efficient and environmental friendly approaches.

The model is applied to two base cases (representative of urban and rural areas in Italy), and sensitivity analyses are subsequently performed on a set of key variables/parameters (i.e. PL density, PL fill rate and PL annual costs). To support the model development and application, interviews with practitioners (Edwards et al., 2011) were performed. Findings PLs imply lower delivery cost than HD, independently from the implementation area (urban or rural): advantages mainly derive from the higher delivery density and the drastic reduction of failed deliveries. Benefits entailed by PLs are more significant in rural areas due to lower PL investments and annual costs, as well as higher HD costs. Originality/value This paper offers insights to both academics and practitioners. On the academic side, it develops a model to compare the delivery cost of PL and HD, which includes the analysis of urban and rural contexts. This could serve as a platform for developing/informing future analytical/optimisation contributions. On the managerial side, it may support practitioners in making decisions about the implementation of PLs and HD, to benchmark their costs and to identify the main variables and parameters at play.},

	abstract = {In the literature, city logistics in terms of last mile delivery on the e-commerce market is quite new area of research that is not thoroughly investigated. It can be observed that there are many papers discussing various topics from the perspective of different groups of stakeholders such as residents, governments, shippers, receivers, transport companies (CEP), and others. However, there is no holistic approach covering the presented field of research. Therefore, the paper’s purpose is identification of trends in sustainable last mile delivery on e-commerce market in cities from the perspective of various stakeholders. The research method that serves the paper’s purpose is systematic literature review in the above-presented field performed through traditional method and machine learning (VOSviewer). In order to conduct critical analysis of published sources, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were applied. The paper's added value is a comprehensive approach to sustainable city logistics of last mile delivery that includes all stakeholders' perspectives and the identification of trends in this area. During the critical literature analysis, authors identified the relations between stakeholders, the fields of the research, and the trends for developing sustainable last mile delivery on the e-commerce market. It should be noted, that recent articles discuss newer technological and organization solutions, such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, crowd-shipping, parcel lockers, and concentrate on the behavior analysis of e-customers.},

	abstract = {The worldwide trend of urbanization, the rising needs of individuals, and the continuous growth of e-commerce lead to increasing urban delivery activities, which are a substantial driver of traffic and pollution in cities. Due to rising public pressure, emission-reducing measures are increasingly likely to be introduced. Such measures can cover diesel bans or even entire car-free zones, causing drastic effects on delivery networks in urban areas. As an option to reduce the risk of a regulation-induced shock, we present a resilience-oriented network and fleet optimization. We propose an innovative parcel delivery concept for last mile delivery (LMD) operations and develop an optimization model to support tactical planning decisions. Our model minimizes overall operating costs by determining optimal locations for micro depots and it allocates transport vehicles to them. An adjustable CO2-threshold and external costs are included to consider potential regulatory restrictions by city authorities. We implement our model into a decision support system (DSS) that allows analyzing and comparing different scenarios. We provide a computational study by evaluating and discussing our DSS with an example of a mid-sized German city. Our results and findings demonstrate the trade-off between cost and emission minimization by quantifying the impacts of various fleet compositions. The proposed logistics concept represents an option to achieve environmentally friendly, cost-efficient, and resilient LMD of parcels.},

At the same time, the industry is affected by various issues, inefficiencies, and externalities, particularly in the last-mile segment. As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors’ business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas. Finally, the decision support system is tested using real data of the city of Turin.},

	abstract = {Growth in e-commerce has led to increasing use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62\% of the total vehicle round time and 40\% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.},

A new powerful adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic is developed and successfully applied to a large pool of new benchmark instances.

However, such measures remain difficult to assess with traditional transport models. This article proposes a different approach: an agent-oriented model. To reproduce realistic applications in an urban context (a metropolis), we investigate the preferences and choices of different agents based on utilities and focus on a modal choice performed through a multinomial logit model. Moreover, we propose some methodological elements to identify the individuals’ profiles using public data (census and travel surveys). We also show that this model, applied in a real case study (Lille, France), is able to reproduce travel behaviors when combining private cars and public transport. Moreover, we focus on the role played by park-and-ride facilities in this context. Thus, the simulation framework makes it possible to better understand individuals’ intermodal travel behavior and assess its development policies.},

The use of real-time information systems in logistics operations generates an enormous amount of data, nowadays used mainly for the purpose of monitoring and control of large flows of goods.

Recently, digital twins have received a lot of attention to support advanced experimentation, simu­ lation and decision-making for on-demand logistics operations. Questions still remain on how to realize these for urban logistics management in a mixed public-private stakeholder context. We argue that this lack of a specific framework for city logistics with a model library for data mergers, linking physical and virtual data exchange, can compromise the timely adoption of digital twin technology. We contribute to filling this gap by presenting a systematic review of the literature, proposing a conceptual framework for digital twin applications in urban logistics, and providing use case scenarios for their demonstration. Together, these should advance the technical implementation of digital twins in a sustainable city logistics context.},

Moreover, this paper presents a method for using statistical raster (250 m) census data for all activities and facilities, which guarantees a high spatial resolution. The synthetic population was developed for the predominantly rural to intermediately urban state of Carinthia in Austria. Realistic travel plans were assigned to each agent, considering trip dependencies between household members as well as correlations between socio-demographic attributes and travel behaviour. The resulting synthetic population includes agents with a sequence of activities for 24 hours. The activities and trip length distributions of the simulated population fit the survey data well.

Although different software dedicated to the simulation of disaggregate travel demand have emerged, the amount of needed input data, in particular the characteristics of a synthetic population, is large and not commonly available, due to legit privacy concerns. In this paper, a methodology to spatially assign a synthetic population by exploiting only publicly available aggregate data is proposed, providing a systematic approach for an efficient treatment of the data needed for activity-based demand generation. The assignment of workplaces exploits aggregate statistics for economic activities and land use classifications to properly frame origins and destination dynamics. The methodology is validated in a case study for the city of Tallinn, Estonia, and the results show that, even with very limited data, the assignment produces reliable results up to a 500 × 500 m resolution, with an error at district level generally around 5\%. Both the tools needed for spatial assignment and the resulting dataset are available as open source, so that they may be exploited by fellow researchers.},

	abstract = {Agent-based microscopic traffic simulation models are gaining popularity over traditional trip-based traffic models due to their superiority in modeling household member interaction, car-sharing, vehicle interaction, etc. Calibrating these models is challenging due to the intrinsic complexity, e.g., nonlinearity, high simulation time, and lack of closed-form expressions. With multimodal large-scale networks, this problem becomes even more severe. This paper proposes a metamodel-based simulation optimization framework for calibrating an agent-based multimodal traffic microsimulator. The metamodel serves as a surrogate of the simulation model for faster and more tractable calibration optimization. In particular, a simplified multimodal traffic model is developed and incorporated in the metamodel. This paper also develops and compares three gradient-based metamodel schemes, taking account of the derivatives of link flows with respect to the calibration parameters in the metamodel fitting process. Numerical results on a toy network show that the proposed metamodel incorporating an analytical traffic model is more efficient and highly adaptable compared to the conventional pure polynomial metamodel schemes. Moreover, taking into account gradient information in the metamodels improves the performance of convergence and solution quality. The proposed metamodel-based method is further applied to calibrate the simulation of an actual network in Hong Kong. The results confirm the applicability of the proposed calibration method for large-scale networks. The proposed framework can be applied to other simulation-based optimization problems as well.},

	abstract = {Agent-based transport models such as MATSim have been developed and used for the past few decades to simulate transportation systems in different cities and are capable of accurately reproducing travel patterns at different levels of aggregation. Given their disaggregate representation of both travel demand and supply as well as the high level of spatial and temporal detail, agent-based transport models also have the potential to allow for unprecedentedly detailed and disaggregated analysis. When simulating large study areas, it is often common to increase the replanning rate to achieve a quicker convergence. However, this comes at the cost of causing substantial oscillations in link-level dynamics which render disaggregate analysis difficult, if not impossible. This paper tries to reconcile both objectives: favour quicker convergence as with higher replanning rates while mitigating the strong oscillations of the link-level dynamics.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel evolutionary optimization strategy based on the derandomized evolution strategy with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES). This new approach is intended to reduce the number of generations required for convergence to the optimum. Reducing the number of generations, i.e., the time complexity of the algorithm, is important if a large population size is desired: (1) to reduce the effect of noise; (2) to improve global search properties; and (3) to implement the algorithm on (highly) parallel machines. Our method results in a highly parallel algorithm which scales favorably with large numbers of processors. This is accomplished by efficiently incorporating the available information from a large population, thus significantly reducing the number of generations needed to adapt the covariance matrix. The original version of the CMA-ES was designed to reliably adapt the covariance matrix in small populations but it cannot exploit large populations efficiently. Our modifications scale up the efficiency to population sizes of up to 10n, where n is the problem dimension. This method has been applied to a large number of test problems, demonstrating that in many cases the CMA-ES can be advanced from quadratic to linear time complexity.},

Given the fact that people are subject to transportation, constraints related to quality of service are usually present, such as time windows and maximum user ride time limits. In many real world applications, different types of users exist. In the field of patient and disabled people transportation, up to four different transportation modes can be distinguished. In this article we consider staff seats, patient seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. Furthermore, most companies involved in the transportation of the disabled or ill dispose of different types of vehicles. We introduce both aspects into state-of-the-art formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for the standard dial-a-ride problem. Also a recent metaheuristic method is adapted to this new problem. In addition, a further service quality related issue is analyzed: vehicle waiting time with passengers aboard. Instances with up to 40 requests are solved to optimality. High quality solutions are obtained with the heuristic method.},

Whereas traditional approaches rely on assumed statistical correlation, TAPAS relies on causality, i.e., the focus is on the decisions and negotiations that lead to activities. TAPAS is composed of two connected layers, one that simulates the physical activities, e.g., production and transportation, and one that simulates the decision making and interaction between actors. We illustrate TAPAS with a scenario in which the consequences of three transport policy and infrastructure measures are studied.},

Urban air mobility (UAM), i.e., the on-demand concept that utilizes eVTOL aircraft, might substantially reduce travel times when compared to ground-based transportation. Trips of three, pre-existent, and calibrated agent-based transport scenarios (Munich Metropolitan Region, Île-de-France, and San Francisco Bay Area) have been routed using the UAM-extension for the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) to calculate congested trip travel times for each trip’s original mode—i.e., car or public transport (PT)—and UAM. The resulting travel times are compared and allow the deduction of potential UAM trip shares under varying UAM properties, such as the number of stations, total process time, and cruise flight speed. Under base-case conditions, the share of motorized trips for which UAM would reduce the travel times ranges between 3\% and 13\% across the three scenarios. Process times and number of stations heavily influence these potential shares, where the vast majority of UAM trips would be below 50 km in range. Compared to car usage, UAM’s (base case) travel times are estimated to be competitive beyond the range of a 50-minute car ride and are less than half as much influenced by congestion.},

We propose a simulation framework that facilitates analyzing the potential demand of UAM. We define five scenarios (ranging from representations of a niche application to a mass transport option) by varying the fleet size, available technologies, infrastructure placement, and pricing strategies. These scenarios are fed into an extended version of the agent-based transport simulation platform MATSim chained with the microscopic transportation orchestrator. The simulation results show that the system configuration has a big impact on UAM demand. The infrastructure capacity and fleet size were identified as the main bottlenecks. We see high levels of demand during peak hours and for trips up to 20 km; however, none of the scenarios result in a sufficiently high modal share of UAM that substantially reduces traffic volumes of ground-based modes, and hence have no significant impact on congestion. Yet, the different trip purposes generate significantly different demands. UAM for airport access could be an especially relevant modal choice in the premium airport-passenger segment. When aiming for an effective and sustainable UAM service, our recommendations are as follows: first, use it to support and improve, rather than cannibalize, existing public transport options; and second, minimize negative impacts on the environment and society to maximize public acceptance.},

	abstract = {The market share of mobility on-demand (MoD) services strongly increased in recent years and is expected to rise even higher once vehicle automation is fully available. These services might reduce space consumption in cities as fewer parking spaces are required if private vehicle trips are replaced. If rides are shared additionally, occupancy related trafﬁc efﬁciency is increased. Simulations help to identify the actual impact of MoD on a trafﬁc system, evaluate new control algorithms for improved service efﬁciency and develop guidelines for regulatory measures. This paper presents the opensource agent-based simulation framework FleetPy. FleetPy (written in the programming language "Python") is explicitly developed to model MoD services in a high level of detail. It specially focuses on the modeling of interactions of users with operators while its ﬂexibility allows the integration and embedding of multiple operators in the overall transportation system. Its modular structure ensures the transferabillity of previously developed elements and the selection of an appropriate level of modeling detail. This paper compares existing simulation frameworks for MoD services and highlights exclusive features of FleetPy. The upper level simulation ﬂows are presented, followed by required input data for the simulation and the output data FleetPy produces. Additionally, the modules within FleetPy and high-level descriptions of current implementations are provided. Finally, an example showcase for Manhattan, NYC provides insights into the impacts of different modules for simulation ﬂow, ﬂeet optimization, traveler behavior and network representation.},

	abstract = {Dynamic pricing plays an important role in modern Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in solving problems such as congestion control, peak load reduction, mobility management of traditional or Electric Vehicles (EVs) in cost-effective manner. It also facilitates the construction of an eco-friendly environment in the society by optimized route planning of vehicles. However, framing dynamic pricing strategies for ITS has always been a challenging task keeping in view of various constraints. An in-efficient dynamic pricing technique may lead to the mismanagement of vehicles, which results an increase in the waiting time of vehicles, an increase in air and noise pollution, wastage of electric and other sources of energies. On the contrary, efficient dynamic pricing strategies can provide satisfaction to all stakeholders, including service providers and service consumers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive literature review and analysis of dynamic pricing techniques used in the literature for ITS. The analysis presented in the paper gives new insights to the readers for the applications of one of the techniques in comparison to its merits over the others. Various problems solved by the dynamic pricing techniques, importance of various evaluation parameters, limitations of dynamic pricing techniques and their applications are discussed in-depth in this paper. Different taxonomies used for exploring various issues of dynamic pricing are also presented in a structured manner. Moreover, advantages and limitations of various dynamic pricing techniques are explored and discussed in the paper. Finally, existing challenges and future research directions of dynamic pricing in ITS are presented.},

	abstract = {A considerable amount of research has been devoted to understanding and modeling carsharing services in the past. However, a research question that has not been investigated yet is how carsharing companies affect each other in a competitive market. This paper presents a methodology, based on the MATSim framework, for investigating the interaction of carsharing competitors and uses it to analyze the possible competition of two free-floating carsharing companies in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. It further provides a first attempt to allow agents to make mode-choice decisions based on a discrete choice model that includes carsharing alternatives on a whole plan level. Relocation capabilities are added to the carsharing module that allow for testing of various relocation algorithms. The paper investigates the competition of carsharing operators on two levels. First, by investigating the impact of different price levels, and second, by allowing one or both of the competitors to perform relocations. The obtained results show that (1) with fixed market rate, operators can obtain the highest profit by offering the service at 0.41 CHF/min, (2) offering different pricing schemes can lead to a higher cumulative payoff, although one of the competitors is left with a reduced profit and (3) performing relocations is unprofitable for the company tasked with the burden of doing it, whilst a competitor may enjoy a free-rider effect with an increasing number of rentals and higher profit.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the social dimension of travel, and how travel decisions are influenced not only by the global state of the transportation system, but also by joint decisions and interactions with social contacts. Empirical studies pointed out the relevance of certain types of social interactions to model travel behavior correctly: synchronization of household members has been identified as significantly influencing individual’s travel decisions, and friendships were shown to influence the choice of leisure locations.Multiagent approaches, by representing decision making at the level of the individual, seem to be one of the most promising approaches to take into account such interactions when forecasting.The work presented here extends a state of the art multiagent simulation software, MATSim, with capabilities to capture joint decisions. It consists of a general framework to allow arbitrary joint behaviors to be represented, without constraints on the topology of the social network. An implementation of this framework for the important case of intrahousehold ride sharing is proposed, and demonstrated on a simple test scenario.The results show that the extended process is able to find the expected state, and is mature for validation against travel diary data.},

	abstract = {It is a general trend in transportation planning to try to minimize the negative externalities of the transport system as a whole, such as noise or pollutant emissions. One of the ways to achieve this is to reduce the number of cars on the roads, for instance by increasing car occupancy. This paper focuses on evaluating the potential of this possibility. The factors influencing this potential are manifold: behavioral, structural (number of potential matches), organizational (quality of available services to meet co-travelers). In previous studies, mainly the behavioral and organizational factors were analyzed. This paper focuses on the structural factor. To do so, the highly detailed daily plans generated by the multi-agent microsimulation software MATSim are searched for potential matches. Information about the potential matches is used to assess the feasibility of carpooling. In particular, it is shown that when considering only structural factors, it is possible to group most of the car trips into two-person car-pools. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that there is no structural obstacle to carpooling development, and thus that the causes of the low share of this mode is to search in both the behavioral and organizational factors.},

Advances in agent-based simulation allow us to estimate the dynamic emissions produced by vehicles at a fine resolution, with each vehicle modelled individually. The scalability of these models allow decision-makers to evaluate large-scale scenarios. But how good are these models? In this paper, the authors apply a state-of-the-art emissions model in the Multi Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) framework to simulate individual vehicle emissions. Simulation results are compared with real driving emissions tests, using a portable emissions measurement device on a light and heavy vehicle. Quantifying the gap between macro-level simulation and actual emissions, the paper contributes by showing that pollutants are significantly underestimated, especially for heavy vehicles. This confirms prior micro-scale studies and magnifies the detrimental impact of using uncorrected aggregated models to inform environmental policy affecting transport.},

	abstract = {Among the new transportation services made possible by the introduction of automated vehicles, automated mobility-ondemand (AMoD) has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and researchers. AMoD provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible AMoD modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform (SimMobility). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different AMoD operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where AMoD is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of AMoD, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of AMoD, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.},

	abstract = {Reducing emissions caused by urban freight transportation is an increasingly important policy objective for transportation planners around the world. New and innovative ways of data collection provide new possibilities to analyze these issues. In this paper we present MASS-GT, a new multi-agent simulation system for urban goods transport. The empirical basis is provided by an exceptionally large dataset of truck trip travel diaries for The Netherlands that was collected from transportation management systems using an automated data collection interface. The dataset is very dense and includes information on vehicles, routes, and shipments carried. The strategic part of the model simulates the formation of individual shipments based on logistic processes at a strategic level, such as sourcing, distribution channel choice and shipment size choice. At tactical level disaggregate choices are simulated for tour formation, vehicle type- and time of day choice, based on observed distributions. The multi-agent approach allows to implement heterogeneous preferences and thus differentiated responses to new policies. We present an application of the model to study the impacts of urban consolidation centers (UCC) and zero emission zones. The freight transportation volumes transported to these UCC and their impact on logistic indicators are analyzed. Simulation results show that vehicle kilometers travelled within the wider region increase with the introduction of UCC, and at the same time the efficiency of deliveries increases as well. Thus the model allows to study trade-offs between regional and local systems that emerge from different behavioural responses to policies.},

Car sharing also reduces the number of private vehicles on the road because members do not purchase their own car. However, the traditional carsharing business model is difﬁcult to scale geographically to neighborhoods with lower population densities because the operator must bear the upfront ﬁxed cost of purchasing or leasing the vehicles in the ﬂeet. In contrast to traditional carsharing, Peerto-Peer (P2P) carsharing allows car owners to convert their personal vehicles into shared cars which can be rented to other drivers on a short-term basis. This model leverages the fact that most privately owned vehicles sit idle over 90\% of the day. This paper presents a simulation study and a reservation control policy (RCP) to increase the revenue generated from P2P carsharing. The results show that rejecting reservations, even when the time slot is available, increases revenue when the demand is sufﬁciently high.},

To identify the main decisions in a carsharing system, and the inputs and interactions among them, it is crucial to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the literature as well as the business practices and context. To this aim, a holistic and in-depth literature review is conducted to structure distinct streams of literature and their main findings. Then, we describe some of the key decisions and business practices that are often oversimplified in the literature. Finally, we propose a conceptual decision-support framework that systematizes the interactions between the usually isolated problems in the academic literature and business practices, integrating the perspectives of carsharing organizations and of their users. From the proposed framework, we identify relevant research gaps and ways to bridge them in the future, toward more realistic and applicable research.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing is a system where car owners rent their vehicle out to other individuals, usually through a facilitating company. One public policy objective of carsharing is to reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT), which happens as members (renters) reduce car ownership. With a P2P system, VMT reductions could also occur if vehicle owners leave their car to be rented when they would normally drive. This paper assesses how participation in P2P carsharing affects the driving behavior of participating car owners. Data are from 235 car owners in Portland, Oregon who enrolled in a P2P program. The analysis is based on surveys, vehicle use data collected via in-vehicle GPS, and in-depth interviews. Overall, vehicle owners made very few changes to their driving behavior according to the GPS data, with average vehicle use increasing slightly. However, a subset of owners (39\%) did decrease their driving by 10\% or more one year after the baseline. Factors associated with this reduction in use included higher baseline vehicle use, higher rental activity, income constraints, and more flexibility in daily travel. In addition, some owners appear to use P2P as a catalyst to change travel behavior, including increased use of other modes.},

	abstract = {Within the growing suite of shared mobility options, peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing provides an opportunity for vehicle owners to rent out their vehicle to other individuals through informal arrangements or more typically through a facilitating company/broker. Despite the potential to offset some of the costs of vehicle ownership and contribute more broadly to the shared economy, barriers remain including that of sharing one’s own vehicle with a stranger. Driverless vehicles (DVs) provide potential to partially address this barrier to carsharing, but it is unknown if this will be embraced by vehicle owners per se and to what extent this might be influenced by their personal characteristics and values. Within this context, the current paper evaluates the joint attitudes of 751 Australian vehicle owners towards sharing of their current vehicle and embracing DVs. Overall, while most respondents remain concerned about DV technology, they understand the benefits, expressing higher concerns about carsharing. Segmentation procedures are used to profile participants on key dimensions including their willingness-to-purchase a DV, demographics, personality and psychological constructs and contextual factors. Four classes of vehicle owners are identified with 14\% being ambivalent to sharing and DVs, 14\% highly concerned, 48\% being ‘on the fence’ and 24\% expressing positive sentiments towards these new forms of mobility. Ambivalence appears to be more pronounced with significantly older, male participants who are less agreeable and conscientious, while concern seems to be a trait of older females more adhering to security, tradition, conformity, and benevolence. Conversely, positive sentiments are associated with participants who are slightly older, male, more open-minded, while less benevolent and traditional. Findings highlight the importance of offering tailored packages of information, messages and services that appeal to the personal benefits and cost savings for some segments of the community, but which highlight the altruistic benefit of sharing for others.},

	abstract = {Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have been studied through analytical dispatch methods and simulation. A common question of interest is how many customers can be served per SAV, which necessarily depends on the network characteristics, travel demand, and dispatch policy. We identify equations that describe the maximum set of demands that could be served if an appropriate dispatch policy were chosen. We then provide a dispatch policy that achieves the predicted level of passenger throughput. This is achieved for a general class of SAV behaviors which may include ridesharing, electric SAV recharging, integration with public transit, or combinations thereof. We accomplish this by defining a Markov chain queueing model which admits general SAV behaviors. We say the network is stable if the head-of-line waiting times remain bounded, which is equivalent to serving all customers at the same rate at which they request service. We give equations characterizing the stable region Λ — the set of demands that could be served by any dispatch policy. We prove that any demand outside Λ cannot be completely served. We further prove that our dispatch policy stabilizes the network for any demand in the stable region using Lyapunov drift, establishing Λ as the maximum set of demand that can be served. Numerical results validate our calculations using simulation, and we present initial results on calculating Λ for a large city network.},

In this paper, we present regression-based estimation models that provide fast predictions for the travel distance in the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the capacitated vehicle routing problem with Time Windows (CVRP-TW), and the multi-region multi-depot pickup and delivery problem (MR-MDPDP). The use of general characteristics such as distances, time windows, capacities and demands, allows us to extend the models and adjust them to different problems and also to different solution methods. The resulting regression models in most cases achieve good approximations of total travel distances except in cases where strong random noise is present, and outperform previous models.},

The synthetic activity locations are then used to create unchosen alternatives within the choice set for each individual. This is followed by the mode-choice model estimation. We test our approach on three large-scale travel surveys conducted in Switzerland, Île-de-France, and São Paulo. We find that our methodological approach can reconstruct activity locations that accurately match trip Euclidean distances but with location errors that still provide location protection. The discrete mode-choice models estimated on the synthetic locations perform similarly, in terms of goodness of fit and prediction, to the ones obtained from the observed activity locations.},

	abstract = {Ride-pooling has attracted considerable attention from both academia and practitioners in recent years, promising to reduce traffic volumes and its negative impacts in urban areas. Simulation studies have shown that large-scale ride-pooling has the potential to increase vehicle utilization, thereby reducing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and required fleet sizes compared to single-passenger mobility options. However, in the real world, large-scale ride-pooling services are rare and not yet widely implemented, in part due to high operating costs that are expected to decrease substantially with the advent of automated vehicles. Two large-scale ride-pooling fleets are operated by MOIA in Hamburg and Hanover, Germany, and serve as testbeds for future pooled services. For this study, we analyze pre-pandemic demand data from both services from 2019 and 2020 and perform spatial and random forest regressions to understand the (spatial) characteristics of ride-pooling trip origins in both cities. We then examine how well findings from one study area (Hamburg in our case) can be generalized and transferred to other cities (Hanover in our case) to enable spatial predictions beyond areas with an existing service. The regression results are similar in both cities and show the strongest impact on ridepooling demand by the variables capturing the density of workplaces, gastronomy and culture. Given the regression results for Hamburg, we predict trip origins for Hanover and observe that demand is overestimated by all applied models. The spatial lag of X (SLX) model showed the most promising results with an overall overestimation of trip origins below 20\%.},

	abstract = {Analyzing spatial structures of transportation data at various scales can be of prime interest to transportation planning and governance. In recent years, multi-scale spatial analysis methods have been developed and used in fields like ecology and geography, but only a few studies have applied these methods to transportation data. However, such methods can provide an efficient exploratory tool for: identifying those scales at which transportation data vary spatially; modeling the spatial structures at each scale; and determining the processes at work that explain these spatial structures. This paper describes and demonstrates how a multi-scale spatial analysis method, namely distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps (dbMEM), can be applied to study the spatial layout of car ownership. For this analysis, we rely on aggregated census data for small statistical areas within France's Loire-Atlantique administrative region. At first, 176 spatial vectors representing spatial patterns with a positive autocorrelation are constructed. Among the 176 vectors, only 23 significant ones are retained after performing a regression with car ownership as the dependent variable. Next, we divide these spatial vectors into three sub-models representing three spatial scales: broad scale, medium scale, and fine scale. Lastly, we identify a set of sociodemographic factors capable of explaining the spatial variation at each scale, i.e.: the broad-scale variation is mainly explained by population density, couples with children and income variables; the medium scale by couples with children, share of individuals in the 25–54 year age range and income; and the fine scale by couples with children and income variables.},

	abstract = {In rural areas with low population density, demand-responsive transport (DRT) is considered a promising alternative to conventional public transport (PT). With a fleet of smaller vehicles, DRT provides a much more flexible and convenient service. This characteristic makes DRT also a potential mode of transport to serve students in rural areas. If DRT vehicles are used to serve students, then the funding for conventional school buses (or adapted public transport schedules) can be reinvested in the DRT system. This may help to relieve the financial burden experienced by DRT operators and enable the operation of a large-scale DRT service in rural areas. In this study, a demand model for school commutes based on real-world, open-source data for Landkreis Vulkaneifel, a rural region in Germany, is built. Then a feasibility study is carried out using an agent-based transport simulation framework. In the feasibility study, various setups and operational schemes are explored, which are followed by a systematic cost analysis. Based on a conservative estimation, an annual budget of around 1600 Euro per student will be needed to maintain and operate a fleet of DRT vehicles that can transport all the students in the region from home to school on time in the morning. During the remaining time of the day and on school holidays, the vehicles can be used for conventional DRT service for the public.},

The temporal aspect of the output is wholly disaggregated, while the spatial aspect is given on the level of individual buildings. In contrast to other existing models, OMOD is freely available, open-source, works out-of-the-box, can be applied to anywhere in Germany with the ambition to widen the scope to other countries, and only requires freely available OpenStreetMap (OSM) data from the user. With OMOD, it is easy for non-experts to create realistic mobility demand, which can be used in transportation studies, energy system modeling, communications system research, et cetera.

We applied our approach to the greater Munich metropolitan area. Based on the available data in the control totals and microdata, we selected 47 attributes at the municipality level, 13 attributes at the county level, and 14 additional attributes at the borough level for the city of Munich. Attributes are aggregated at the household, dwelling, and person level. The algorithm is able to synthesize 4.5 million persons in 2.1 million households in less than 1.5 h. Directions regarding how to handle multiple geographical resolutions and how to balance the amount and order of attributes to avoid overfitting are presented.},

To accurately assess the noise exposure from urban construction sites, it is essential to consider the variability and dynamic nature of the urban context. This paper proposes an innovative approach using individual-level activity-based modeling to tackle the given challenge. The methodology introduced encompasses: the modeling of construction site noise emission sources, individual-level activity-based modeling of zone of influences, a modeling chain for assessing individual noise exposure levels, and a novel dedicated exposure indicator. To illustrate the relevance of our methodology, a case study is conducted in Champigny-sur-Marne, France; this study involves the generation of a synthetic population of 1,344,394 individuals distributed among 591,153 households, with 4,854,597 associated activities, using the Eqasim simulation framework. A traffic model is then established using the multi-agent transport simulation software MATSim. NoiseModelling software is employed to compute noise maps both with and without the construction site. Subsequently, the noise exposure for each individual is assessed throughout the day for both configurations. Thanks to this complete modeling chain, the proposed indicator quantifying the cumulative amount of time of exposure above a given threshold can be compute, with the case study result being estimated at more than 3,300 person.quarter-hours above 65 dB(A).},

For many small and medium-sized cities, a full replacement of public transport services by these systems seems to be possible. For a transport system operator, such a system requires a bigger fleet of vehicles than before, however, vehicles are less expensive and fewer staff is needed for the actual operation. In this paper, we are using a simulation-based approach to evaluate the service quality and operating cost of a demand responsive transit (DRT) system for the city of Cottbus (100 000 inhabitants), Germany. The simulation model used is based on an existing MATSim model of the region that depicts a typical work day. Results suggest, that the current public transport system may be replaced by a system of 300 to 400 DRT vehicles, depending on their operational mode. Compared to previous, schedule based public transport, passengers do not need to transfer, and their overall travel times may be reduced significantly. Results for the cost comparison are preliminary, but results suggest that an autonomous DRT system is not necessarily more expensive than the current public transport system.},

	abstract = {With the popularization of transportation network companies (TNCs) (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), even major car manufacturers are increasingly considering themselves as autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) providers rather than individual vehicle sellers. However, matching the convenience of owning a vehicle requires providing consistent service quality, taking into account individual expectations. Typically, different classes of users have different service quality (SQ) expectations in terms of responsiveness, reliability, and privacy. Nonetheless, AMoD systems presented in the literature do not enable active control of service quality in the short term, especially in light of unusual demand patterns, sometimes allowing extensive delays and user rejections. This study proposes a method to control the daily operations of an AMoD system that uses the SQ expectations of heterogeneous user classes to dynamically distribute service quality among riders. Additionally, we consider an elastic vehicle supply, that is, privately-owned freelance AVs (FAVs) can be hired on short notice to help providers meeting user service-level expectations. We formalize the problem as the dial-a-ride problem with service quality contracts (DARP-SQC) and propose a multi-objective matheuristic to address real-world requests from Manhattan, New York City. Applying the proposed service-level constraints, we improve user satisfaction (in terms of reached service-level expectations) by 53\% on average compared to conventional ridesharing systems, even without hiring additional vehicles. By deploying service-quality-oriented on-demand hiring, our hierarchical optimization approach allows providers to adequately cater to each segment of the customer base without necessarily owning large fleets.},

	abstract = {A recent wave of research has attempted to define fairness quantitatively. In particular, this work has explored what fairness might mean in the context of decisions based on the predictions of statistical and machine learning models. The rapid growth of this new field has led to wildly inconsistent motivations, terminology, and notation, presenting a serious challenge for cataloging and comparing definitions. This article attempts to bring much-needed order. First, we explicate the various choices and assumptions made—often implicitly—to justify the use of prediction-based decision-making. Next, we show how such choices and assumptions can raise fairness concerns and we present a notationally consistent catalog of fairness definitions from the literature. In doing so, we offer a concise reference for thinking through the choices, assumptions, and fairness considerations of prediction-based decision-making.},

	abstract = {Increasing population and travel demand has prompted new efforts to model travel demand across the United States. One such model is rJourney that estimates travel demand among thousands of regions and models mode and destination choice. rJourney includes records representing 1.17 billion long-distance trips throughout the year 2010. Although inter-regional impacts caused by an increase of automated vehicles (AVs) has been investigated, there is little research on inter-regional travel and how longer distance destination and mode choices will change. Because of conveniences offered by AVs, the value of travel time of drivers is expected to fall, thus reducing the generalized cost of AV travel. To initially analyze the impacts of AVs in the United States, a new AV mode was added to a subset of the rJourney mode and destination choice models. With an initial scenario assuming an operating cost of AVs that is 118\% of traditional cars, two outcomes are observed that are solely based on model results. First, the attractiveness of AVs severely digs into the airline travel market, reducing airline revenues to 53\%. Second, the introduction of AVs results in a shift of destination choice, increasing travel in further distances for personal vehicles, but favoring closer distances across all modes, for an overall 6.7\% decline in US passenger-miles traveled on existing long-distance trips. While this preliminary research has revealed an initial perspective on how an existing model can support AVs, the increasing availability of data as AVs emerge will refine nationwide long-distance modeling.},

However, questions regarding regulations, infrastructure requirements, and economic constraints remain to be answered. Therefore, this review aims at giving an overview on different research areas in the emerging topic of UAM. To this end, findings from several fields within the UAM research community were gathered and are presented here to provide a landscape of relevant questions surrounding the implementation of UAM. This overview considers vehicle-related aspects, such as aircraft requirements and aircraft classification for intra- and inter-city passenger transport, and discusses potential hurdles to their introduction. The exploration of challenges includes questions on certification and policy, as well as challenges in the area of traffic management and ground infrastructure requirements. Besides that, literature on operational concepts, possible market structures and the interaction with existing transport systems will be reviewed. The discussion of hurdles will conclude with a summary of current literature on public acceptance of UAM. An overview of methods for modelling and simulation of UAM will wrap up the prior discussion and provide insights on first modelling results.},

Alongside this effort, we conduct an in-depth review of articles related to demand modeling, operations, and integration with existing infrastructure. We use insights from the meta-analysis and comprehensive review to inform future UAM research directions. Some of the potential research directions we identify include: (1) developing more refined demand models that incorporate the timing of when individuals will adopt UAM; (2) developing high-fidelity simulation models for UAM operations that capture interactions among vertiport locations, vertiport topology, demand, pricing, dispatching, and airspace restrictions; (3) explicitly considering one-way demand and parking constraints in demand and operational models; and (4) developing more realistic time-of-day energy profiles for UAM vehicles in order to assess whether the current electrical grid can support UAM operations.},

	abstract = {Iterative proportional ﬁtting (IPF) is a widely used method for spatial microsimulation. The technique results in non-integer weights for individual rows of data. This is problematic for certain applications and has led many researchers to favour combinatorial optimisation approaches such as simulated annealing. An alternative to this is ‘integerisation’ of IPF weights: the translation of the continuous weight variable into a discrete number of unique or ‘cloned’ individuals. We describe four existing methods of integerisation and present a new one. Our method – ‘truncate, replicate, sample’ (TRS) – recognises that IPF weights consist of both ‘replication weights’ and ‘conventional weights’, the effects of which need to be separated. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) separate replication and conventional weights by truncation; (2) replication of individuals with positive integer weights; and (3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible using supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS is fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation.},

	abstract = {Good mobility simulations require a synthetic population to produce adequate representations of the real mobility behaviour in a country. In the case of Switzerland, current best practices involve the hand-crafting of a synthetic population based on general public data and restricted household travel survey (in Switzerland called micro-censuses) information. The restricted information is also causing many synthetic population models to be generated in closed-source making comparisons of different synthetic populations difficult. Furthermore, the manual sourcing of data quickly becomes outdated and requires repeated manual updating to stay up-to-date which is rarely performed. Recent advances around MATSim have made the simulation platform more accessible through the eqasim pipeline that prepares a synthetic population and its travel demand and loads it into MATSim for direct use. However, the automated acquisition of the baseline data for the synthetic population is still an open issue. In this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline from opendata.swiss and proxies for the restricted micro-census. While we cannot provide full transparency without impinging on privacy for the micro-census, we can make all other transformations transparent and rely on proxies for the micro-census. Here, we present an updated eqasim simulation of Switzerland based on the previously published work comparing the existing synthetic population with our automatically updated synthetic population.},

	abstract = {Urban mobility contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and comes with negative social impacts for various groups, such as limited accessibility to opportunity or basic services. Transitions towards sustainable and people-centred urban mobility systems are paramount. Yet, this is accompanied by various challenges. Complex urban systems are accompanied by high uncertainties (e.g., technological progress, demographics, climate change) which are currently not well integrated. Possible solutions originate from design, policymaking, and innovation, with a widespread disconnection due to non-compatible methods. This paper presents a method to improve the ability to design future urban mobility systems by integrating different approaches for modelling what the future could be and who could be the users. The research question is how diverse future user needs can be integrated in design processes for urban mobility systems. The proposed scenario-based design and personas allows to create data-driven proto-personas—a set of archetypical users with assigned characteristics and behaviours—test their validity, derive distributions across geographical areas, and transform them for different 2030 scenarios. This serves as input to create full personas and synthetic populations as intermediary design objects for the collaboration of designers and simulation experts. The methodology is exemplarily applied in the context of Paris. It contributes to urban mobility solution design that is more aware of future uncertainty and diverse needs of users, therefore, better capable to respond to today’s challenges. The approach is replicable with open data and accessible source code: https://github.com/TjarkGall/proto-persona-clustering.},

	abstract = {Can dynamic ride-sharing reduce traffic congestion? In this paper we show that the answer is yes if the trip density is high, which is usually the case in large-scale networks but not in medium-scale networks where opportunities for sharing in time and space become rather limited. When the demand density is high, the dynamic ride-sharing system can significantly improve traffic conditions, especially during peak hours. Sharing can compensate extra travel distances related to operating a mobility service. The situation is entirely different in small and medium-scale cities when trip shareability is small, even if the ride-sharing system is fully optimized based on the perfect demand prediction in the near future. The reason is simple, mobility services significantly increase the total travel distance, and sharing is simply a means of combating this trend without eliminating it when the trip density is not high enough. This paper proposes a complete framework to represent the functioning of the ride-sharing system and multiple steps to tackle the curse of dimensionality when solving the problem. We address the problem for two city scales in order to compare different trip densities. A city scale of 25 km2 with a total market of 11,235 shareable trips for the medium-scale network and a city scale of 80 km2 with 205,308 demand for service vehicles for the large-scale network over a 4-hour period with a rolling horizon of 20 minutes. The solutions are assessed using a dynamic trip-based macroscopic simulation to account for the congestion effect and dynamic travel times that may influence the optimal solution obtained with predicted travel times. This outperforms most previous studies on optimal fleet management that usually consider constant and fully deterministic travel time functions.},

	abstract = {With the popularization of transportation network companies (TNCs) (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), even major car manufacturers are increasingly considering themselves as autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) providers rather than individual vehicle sellers. However, matching the convenience of owning a vehicle requires providing consistent service quality, taking into account individual expectations. Typically, different classes of users have different service quality (SQ) expectations in terms of responsiveness, reliability, and privacy. Nonetheless, AMoD systems presented in the literature do not enable active control of service quality in the short term, especially in light of unusual demand patterns, sometimes allowing extensive delays and user rejections. This study proposes a method to control the daily operations of an AMoD system that uses the SQ expectations of heterogeneous user classes to dynamically distribute service quality among riders. Additionally, we consider an elastic vehicle supply, that is, privately-owned freelance AVs (FAVs) can be hired on short notice to help providers meeting user service-level expectations. We formalize the problem as the dial-a-ride problem with service quality contracts (DARP-SQC) and propose a multi-objective matheuristic to address real-world requests from Manhattan, New York City. Applying the proposed service-level constraints, we improve user satisfaction (in terms of reached service-level expectations) by 53\% on average compared to conventional ridesharing systems, even without hiring additional vehicles. By deploying service-quality-oriented on-demand hiring, our hierarchical optimization approach allows providers to adequately cater to each segment of the customer base without necessarily owning large fleets.},

Activity generation and scheduling components of TASHA are validated using 1996 and 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. This validation proceeds in two parts: (a) verification that TASHA replicates the 1996 base case upon which the model was originally built; and (b) comparison of TASHA’s forecasts of 2001 daily travel behaviour with observed travel survey data for 2001. TASHA activity generation and scheduling model components replicate observed activities with good accuracy and precision for the base year. Although TASHA is not able to predict an observed increase in activity participation rate in a five year forecast, the distribution of activities in the day is forecast with greater success. Predictions of average travel distance are oversimulated in the base year by 0.9\%. Increased average distances are underpredicted for school, shopping, and other activities, and are overpredicted for work and return home activities. These validation results are promising, although there exist opportunities to improve model performance, and to further validate other elements of the TASHA model.},

The development stages discussed in this paper range from an initial static activity-based model without traffic assignment to a dynamic activity-based model that incorporates rescheduling, learning effects, and traffic routing. To illustrate the FEATHERS framework, work that has been done on the development of static and dynamic activity-based models for Flanders (Belgium) and the Netherlands is discussed. First, the data collection is presented. Next, the four-stage activity-based model development trajectory is discussed in detail. The paper concludes with the presentation of the modular FEATHERS framework, which discusses the functionalities of the modules and how they accommodate the requirements imposed on the framework by each of the four stages.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the demand for emerging transportation technologies and policies can vary by time of day due to spillbacks on roadways, rescheduling of travelers’ activity patterns, and shifting to other modes that affect the level of congestion. These effects are not well-captured with static travel demand models. We calibrate and validate the first open-source multi-agent simulation model for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating policies such as congestion pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is loaded with an 8M + synthetic 2016 population calibrated in a prior study. The road network is calibrated to INRIX speed data and average annual daily traffic for a screenline along the East River crossings, resulting in average speed differences of 7.2\% on freeways and 17.1\% on arterials, leading to average difference of +1.8\% from the East River screenline. Validation against transit stations shows an 8\% difference from observed counts and median difference of 29\% for select road link counts. The model is used to evaluate a congestion pricing plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggests a much higher (127K) car trip reduction compared to their report (59K). The pricing policy would impact the population segment making trips within Manhattan differently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan: benefits from congestion reduction benefit the former by about 110\%+ more than the latter. The multiagent simulation can show that 37.3\% of the Manhattan segment would be negatively impacted by the pricing compared to 39.9\% of the non-Manhattan segment, which has implications for redistribution of congestion pricing revenues. The citywide travel consumer surplus decreases when the congestion pricing goes up from \$9.18 to \$14 both ways even as it increases for the Charging-related population segment. This implies that increasing pricing from \$9.18 to \$14 benefits Manhattanites at the expense of the rest of the city.},

Based on a previous work which has calibrated a first instantiation of the mobility model to the Paris region, we extend it by modeling and simulating two forms of intermodality: Park-and-Walk and Park-and-Ride. After re-calibrating the model, we evaluate two policy scenarios featuring different scales of the restriction zone, using indicators related to mobility, traffic emissions, and social cost. The analysis puts special attention on how modal shift and emissions vary across space, that is, inside and outside the policy zone. We find that the small-scale scenario with a restriction zone limited to the Paris center leads to very limited modal shift, whereas the larger-scale policy scenario encompassing the whole of Paris shifts significantly more trips (about 1.4\% of total trips) from cars to public transport and other modes. In both scenarios, traffic emissions decline in the restriction zone and its near surroundings. Far from the restriction zone, however, emissions increase in the small-scale scenario but decrease in the large-scale scenario. These differences are caused by the traffic detour, modal shift, and rebound effects, the magnitudes of which vary depending on the scale of the restriction zone. The driving restrictions also cause the social cost to increase by around 10\% in both scenarios. This ultimately implies a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing user costs, with a substantially greater efficiency (larger reduction for similar cost) in the large-scale policy scenario.},

The impact on mode choice behavior and traffic volumes has been difficult to measure as the pilot projects are rather small interventions and before-after-analyses were rarely conducted. In this article, we therefore use an agent-based mesososcopic traffic simulation (MATSim) to model different configurations and numbers of Superblocks. In the case study for the city of Vienna 61 scenarios with up to 46 Superblocks are simulated. The results show that the number of car trips in the affected Superblocks decrease linearly by around 100 car trips per day and Superblock.},

The types of service differ in timeliness and compensation and, until now, providers operate larger fleets separately for each type of service. While this may ensure sufficient resources for lucrative passenger transportation, the separation also leaves consolidation potentials untapped. In this paper, we propose combining both services in an anticipatory way that ensures high passenger service rates while simultaneously transporting a large number of goods. To this end, we introduce a dynamic priority policy that uses a time-dependent percentage of vehicles mainly to serve passengers. To find effective time-dependent parametrizations given a limited number of runtime-expensive simulations, we apply Bayesian optimization. We show that our anticipatory policy increases revenue and service rates significantly, whereas a myopic combination of service may actually lead to inferior performance compared to using two separate fleets.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the opportunity to plan for a novel on-demand freight delivery service in urban areas with tight service and sustainability requirements. This contribution first attempts to focus on the feasibility of connecting people and freight mobility through the joint usage of transportation options. It builds on the hyperconnectivity principles enabled by the Physical Internet (PI) manifesto for city logistics, referred to as HCL (Hyperconnected City Logistics). To this end, this paper proposes a model-based decision support approach that seeks to produce effective delivery solutions for an on-demand multimodal transshipment problem. The approach considers multiple mobility options such as on-demand urban delivery services, cargo bikes, tramways, and buses to transship goods from one urban logistic hub to another. This novel short-term response planning problem complements the well-known day-before planning problem. The objective function aims to minimize the impact of freight moves in the time and space of urban transport networks. The proposed solution aims to increase the sustainability of cities by reducing congestion levels, the impact of logistics moves, as well as carbon emissions in urban areas. An illustrative case is provided to demonstrate how the novel multi-mode transportation system could operate and to provide an evaluation of the economic and sustainability benefits of such a system in an urban context. For a hyperconnected network, the impact of freight movements on the time and space of urban transport networks can be reduced by 91\%. The results demonstrate the potential of urban synchromodality in improving economic efficiency, service capability, and sustainability.},

Next, the operational level is focused on to characterize the dynamic transportation problem and to propose two strategies to formulate it. This problem aims to respond to the number of transportation requests arriving on a periodic basis with adequate service level while minimizing the empty movements of a set of electric vehicles with limited battery capacity. An efficient solution approach based on the forward optimization of periodic transportation sub-problems is proposed and validated. The applicability of the PRT–FRT mode is demonstrated and computational results in comparison to other transportation option is also presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Serving both passenger and freight demand with the same vehicle fleet is an ambition that led to the development of several innovative vehicle concepts [10, 26]. This study proposes a simulation-based methodology to investigate the execution of freight tours with an On-Demand fleet of autonomous, modular vehicles while giving priority to passenger transport. Based on assumptions regarding the operational scheme, tour pricing and delivery time windows, the software Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) is extended. The developed methodology is then applied to a Berlin-wide freight delivery scenario. The results show that when using a relatively large vehicle fleet, passenger waiting time statistics barely change. However, it has to be noted that the study should be repeated with different (smaller) fleet sizes. A rough cost analysis for the freight operator suggests that there is a large saving potential when using autonomous On-Demand vehicles instead of an owned fleet. Because of the uncertainty of price composition, further studies to quantify this saving potential have to be made.},

	abstract = {The promotion of urban mobility by integrating people-and-goods transportation has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Within this framework, diversified forms such as co-modality, freight on transit, and crowdshipping have been proposed, piloted or implemented. The success of the implementation and market penetration depends on not only the novelties of the concept but also the planning and operational efficiency. Thus, a comprehensive review focusing on the operation of integrated people-and-goods transportation systems and associated critical decisions and subproblems is performed. Different practical forms in which people and goods are transported in an integrated manner are identified. The critical decisions associated with each form and subproblem are discussed, along with corresponding models and solution approaches. Notably, because integrated transportation systems are in the early exploration stage at present, new forms are expected to emerge. Therefore, this paper proposes a general framework to realise the planning and operation of new forms in the future. The decisions and subproblems identified from existing forms are fed to the proposed general framework to identify two key research opportunities: to improve or extend existing research and to conduct pioneering research to fill the gaps in the frameworks for operating potential forms of integrated people-and-goods transportation.},

It explicitly avoids detailed air pollution concentration calculations and is therefore characterized by little data requirements, reasonable computation times for iterative calculations, and open-source compatibility. In a first step, the paper shows how to derive time-dependent vehicle-specific exposure tolls in an agent-based model. It closes the circle from the polluting entity, to the receiving entity, to damage costs, to tolls, and back to the behavioral change of the polluting entity. In a second step, the approach is applied to a large-scale real-world scenario of the Munich metropolitan area in Germany. Changes in emission levels, exposure costs, and user benefits are calculated. These figures are compared to a flat emission toll, and to a regulatory measure (a speed reduction in the inner city), respectively. The results indicate that the flat emission toll reduces overall emissions more significantly than the exposure toll, but its exposure cost reductions are rather small. For the exposure toll, overall emissions increase for freight traffic which implies a potential conflict between pricing schemes to optimize local emission exposure and others to abate climate change. Regarding the mitigation of exposure costs caused by urban travelers, the regulatory measure is found to be an effective strategy, but it implies losses in user benefits.},

	abstract = {Demand responsive transit (DRT) can provide an alternative to private cars and complement existing public transport services. However, the successful implementation of DRT services remains a challenge as both researchers and policy makers can struggle to determine what sorts of places or cities are suitable for it. Research into car-dependent cities with poor transit accessibility is sparse. This study addresses this problem, investigating the potential of DRT service in Wayne County, U.S.A., whose dominant travel mode is private car. Using an agent-based approach, DRT is simulated as a new mobility option for this region, thereby providing insights into its impact on operational, user, and system-level performance indicators. DRT scenarios are tested for different fleet sizes, vehicle occupancy, and cost policies. The results show that a DRT service in Wayne County has a certain potential, especially to increase the mobility of lower-income individuals. However, introducing the service may slightly increase the overall vehicle kilometers traveled. Specific changes in service characteristics, like service area, pricing structure, or preemptive relocation of vehicles, might be needed to fully realize the potential of pooling riders in the proposed DRT service. The authors hope that this study serves as a starting point for understanding the impacts and potential benefits of DRT in Wayne County and similar low-density and car-dependent urban areas, as well as the service parameters needed for its successful implementation.},

Investigating the EV charging load and its flexibility, e.g., by shifting load, is therefore crucial to ensure a secure and sustainable energy system. We develop an agent-based model to investigate how different plug-in behaviors can affect (future) EV charging load profiles and their spatial–temporal flexibility. We contribute to extant literature by (1) revealing the effect of diverse plug-in behaviors on EV load profiles, particularly the flexibility potential resulting from different plug-in behaviors; (2) presenting the (future) charging load in different spatial structures, i.e. urban, rural, or suburban, and home, work, or public charging locations; and (3) demonstrating the effect of detailed driving profiles in high spatial and temporal resolution. We implement three future scenarios regarding EV and charging infrastructure diffusion and technology developments. We find that the impact of potential changes in plug-in behavior on EV charging load would be highest for urban areas and increases as charging infrastructure becomes more spatially diversified. Decision-makers in policy and industry can use these insights to evaluate the impact of EV charging on distribution grids and design incentives to leverage the flexibility potential of EVs.},

	abstract = {MATSim simulates the mobility of single agents, usually without their household context. Agents either have access to modes for the whole simulation time - or not at all. This is usually fine for walk, pt, and also bike, but not necessarily realistic for car and ride. Riding as a passenger is theoretically only available if there is some other agent driving its car on the same trip at the same time. However, it is usually modeled without this requirement and teleported through the network to not cause any further congestion. Cars can theoretically be shared between household members with a driving license and thus are not available to all eligible members all the time. However, a common practice in generating agent-based models from household travel surveys (HHTS) is, to allow car usage for agents - originating from a household that owned at least one car - all the time. This poses two problems: It leads to an unrealistic number of road vehicles driving on the network, especially at peak hours and an incorrect number of parked vehicles, as a single vehicle from the HTS might be used simultaneously by its household members. In this abstract, we present our work on the effects of considering temporal car availability within a household context and how to model it using a novel resource-constrained replanning approach.},

	abstract = {Within the growing suite of shared mobility options, peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing provides an opportunity for vehicle owners to rent out their vehicle to other individuals through informal arrangements or more typically through a facilitating company/broker. Despite the potential to offset some of the costs of vehicle ownership and contribute more broadly to the shared economy, barriers remain including that of sharing one’s own vehicle with a stranger. Driverless vehicles (DVs) provide potential to partially address this barrier to carsharing, but it is unknown if this will be embraced by vehicle owners per se and to what extent this might be influenced by their personal characteristics and values. Within this context, the current paper evaluates the joint attitudes of 751 Australian vehicle owners towards sharing of their current vehicle and embracing DVs. Overall, while most respondents remain concerned about DV technology, they understand the benefits, expressing higher concerns about carsharing. Segmentation procedures are used to profile participants on key dimensions including their willingness-to-purchase a DV, demographics, personality and psychological constructs and contextual factors. Four classes of vehicle owners are identified with 14\% being ambivalent to sharing and DVs, 14\% highly concerned, 48\% being ‘on the fence’ and 24\% expressing positive sentiments towards these new forms of mobility. Ambivalence appears to be more pronounced with significantly older, male participants who are less agreeable and conscientious, while concern seems to be a trait of older females more adhering to security, tradition, conformity, and benevolence. Conversely, positive sentiments are associated with participants who are slightly older, male, more open-minded, while less benevolent and traditional. Findings highlight the importance of offering tailored packages of information, messages and services that appeal to the personal benefits and cost savings for some segments of the community, but which highlight the altruistic benefit of sharing for others.},

	abstract = {Urban mobility contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and comes with negative social impacts for various groups, such as limited accessibility to opportunity or basic services. Transitions towards sustainable and people-centred urban mobility systems are paramount. Yet, this is accompanied by various challenges. Complex urban systems are accompanied by high uncertainties (e.g., technological progress, demographics, climate change) which are currently not well integrated. Possible solutions originate from design, policymaking, and innovation, with a widespread disconnection due to non-compatible methods. This paper presents a method to improve the ability to design future urban mobility systems by integrating different approaches for modelling what the future could be and who could be the users. The research question is how diverse future user needs can be integrated in design processes for urban mobility systems. The proposed scenario-based design and personas allows to create data-driven proto-personas—a set of archetypical users with assigned characteristics and behaviours—test their validity, derive distributions across geographical areas, and transform them for different 2030 scenarios. This serves as input to create full personas and synthetic populations as intermediary design objects for the collaboration of designers and simulation experts. The methodology is exemplarily applied in the context of Paris. It contributes to urban mobility solution design that is more aware of future uncertainty and diverse needs of users, therefore, better capable to respond to today’s challenges. The approach is replicable with open data and accessible source code: https://github.com/TjarkGall/proto-persona-clustering.},

	abstract = {With the introduction of automated vehicles, new operating regimes for public transport services will become possible. A station-based Automated Transit on Demand service could be an attractive alternative to the current modes of transportation. In this paper, the impact of this kind of service on the modal share for the city of Zurich, Switzerland, and its surrounding area is modeled using an agent-based approach. Different scenarios regarding the operating area, pricing scheme, and a cordon charge are tested on their potential to make use of the benefits of the new service while preventing an overflow of automated vehicles in the urban core. Results show that if left unconstrained the proposed service can substantially impact the demand for public transport. A pricing scheme that bases the pricing of the new service relative to the accessibility of the current public transport service is a promising solution to increase the accessibility of the rural areas while maintaining a high modal share for public transport in the city center. Finally, using an optimization algorithm we show that the total car-fleet and public parking space can be reduced at the cost of a slight increase in vehicle kilometers traveled. Moreover, we find that the cost coverage of the proposed transit service is potentially much higher in comparison to current public transport services.},

	abstract = {Human mobility patterns and their socio-demographic association have been widely studied on travel behavior analysis. To better suit the services of multimodal transport systems, people’s travel behavior needs to be examined at different levels, concerning the complexity of their multimodal trips or trip-chains. This article aims to reveal multimodal patterns of individual mobility and their relationships with socio-demographic characteristics and with travel complexities based on the 2018 Household Travel Survey in the Paris region. To identify the multimodal patterns, a two-stage statistical analysis is conducted. At the first stage (at the trip level), fifteen trip types are identified depending on the categories of travel modes and the degrees of modal trip lengths, duration, and departure time. At the second stage (at the day level), the individuals are characterized by their mobility profiles that are interpreted with the respective frequencies of the fifteen trip types on the day. Based on the profiles, six clusters, i.e., six daily mobility patterns, are obtained. Among the patterns, the daily travel distances vary widely (from 1 to 7 times), as do the daily travel time budgets (from 1 to 3 times). From the relationship analysis, we find that the obtained mobility patterns come along with specific features of car ownership and transit subscription. Socio-demographic associations to the clusters are also distinct. The daily mobility patterns demonstrate an adverse correlation between the trip complexity and the trip chain complexity. The findings in this study could help policy makers to implement concrete strategies for targeted people at multimodality circumstances.},

It provides the background information necessary to better understand the complex relationship between urban structure, the transportation system and household travel patterns. To what extent do travel behaviour reflect the properties of the urban structure and the transportation network, or do these patterns largely follow their own regularities? Can different patterns be observed across different space-time settings, or can common patterns be observed, largely independent from such contexts? To better understand these relationships, this paper reports on some of the findings of analyses, conducted to identify underlying structures in various aspects of travel patterns. Travel patterns, derived from activity and travel diary data collected in Portland (USA), Midlands (UK), Fukuoka (Japan), Canadian metropolitan areas, and the South-Rotterdam region (The Netherlands) are compared. The results indicate that travel patterns are largely independent from spatial setting, except for some extreme cases.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to develop a modeling framework that captures the inter-decision dynamics between mobility service providers (MSPs) and travelers that can be used to optimize and analyze policies/regulations related to MSPs. To meet this goal, the paper proposes a tri-level mathematical programming model with a public-sector decision maker (i.e. a policymaker/regulator) at the highest level, the MSP in the middle level, and travelers at the lowest level. The public-sector decision maker aims to maximize social welfare via implementing regulations, policies, plans, transit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize profit by adjusting its service designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes and routes. The travelers’ decisions depend on the regulator and MSP’s decisions while the MSP decisions themselves depend on the regulator’s decisions. To solve the tri-level mathematical program, the study employs Bayesian optimization (BO) within a simulation–optimization solution approach. At the lowest level, the solution approach includes an agent-based transportation system simulation model to capture travelers’ behavior subject to specific decisions made by the regulator and MSP. At the middle and highest levels, the solution approach employs BO for the MSP to maximize profit and for the regulator to maximize social welfare. The agent-based transportation simulation model includes a mode choice model, a road network, a transit network, and an MSP providing automated mobility-on-demand (AMOD) service with shared rides. The modeling and solution approaches are applied to Munich, Germany in order to validate the model. The case study investigates the tolls and parking costs the city administration should set, as well as changes in the public transport budget and a limitation of the AMOD fleet size. Best policy settings are derived for two social welfare definitions, in both of which the AMOD fleet size is not regulated as the shared-ride AMOD service provides significant value to travelers in Munich.},

	abstract = {In Europe, one of the instruments at the Network Manager’s (NM) disposal to tackle demand-capacity imbalance is to impose ground, i.e. Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM), delays to flights. To compensate for anticipated delays and improve on-time performance, Aircraft Operators usually embed a buffer time in their schedules. The current practice for allocating ATFM delays does not take into account if flights have any remaining schedule buffer to absorb ATFM delay and reduce delay propagation to subsequent flights. Furthermore, the policy presently employed is to minimize ATFM delays, an order of magnitude of half a minute per flight, while propagated delays are approximately ten times higher. In this paper, we explore the possibility to control ATFM delay distribution in a way so as to minimize delay propagated to subsequent flights, but also to increase flights’ adherence to airport slots at coordinated airports. To this aim, we propose a two-level mixed-integer optimization model to solve en-route demand-capacity imbalance problem and further improve airport slot adherence. The rationales behind the research are drawn from practical experience, while the model proposed is compatible with the one currently being used by the NM, making it easy to implement. We test the model on two real-world case studies and conduct ex post analysis to test the effects of violation of model assumptions on results. The results show that it is possible to use the proposed methodology to lower delay propagated to subsequent flights and at the same time to improve airport slot adherence. In addition, they suggest that the current regulatory settings aiming to minimize ATFM delay minutes, as well as operational implementation thereof, are neither necessarily fully aligned with the desires and operating goals of Aircraft Operators, nor they improve the predictability of operations in the network.},

	abstract = {With advancements in technology, digital ride-pooling has become a popular on-demand shared mobility service. However, maintaining system efficiency while achieving high ridership remains a challenging task in such services. Allowing passengers to be transferred between vehicles within the system is a potential way to improve service availability for customers and increase fleet efficiency. This study proposes a non-myopic state-of-the-art dynamic routing algorithm for operating a ride-pooling service with synchronized so-called intramodal transfers. A non-myopic cost function approximation policy is proposed to control for the opportunity cost of transfer decisions in offering a route with or without transfer to a passenger. The policy approximates this cost with the “time until the potential transfer” as online transfers without such consideration are shown to significantly underperform, while the approximation makes transfers at least as competitive as non-myopic ride-pooling without transfers. The policy is tested in a newly developed simulation platform to investigate various scenarios. Experimental results on real-world trip data in Hamburg, Germany, demonstrate the importance of taking a non-myopic approach in making sequential decisions. Although allowing transfers can potentially improve vehicle occupancy, it can be challenging to be implemented in practice, given the added uncertainties in real-world operations.},

This study couples charging and repositioning events as a means of improving service quality (rider wait times), reducing empty travel due to repositioning or charging, and improving fleet utilization (average daily trips per vehicle and charging queues). This synergy is explored for the Austin, Texas region using POLARIS, an agent-based model. On average, wait times were 39\% lower, and average daily trips served per SAEV increased up to 6.4 (or 28\%) compared to SAEV repositioning with heuristic charging. Coupling repositioning with charging decreased the fleet's percent empty travel on average by 1.6\%, relative to the scenario treating them as independent events (which varies by charging station design). Sparser charging stations reduce investment costs, and operators can leverage this framework to keep traveler wait times low.},

This paper presents an end-to-end model to generate a synthetic population of residents in Gothenburg, Sweden, along with activity schedules and mobility patterns for present and past populations. Using a stochastic modelling approach, we describe the model and present its corresponding dataset. The model is designed for applications in neighbourhood planning and includes detailed replicas of people in different neighbourhoods of Gothenburg organised as persons, households, houses, buildings, and daily activity chains. While the persons, households, and houses are synthetic replicas, they are connected to existing buildings. The model considers the allocation of primary and secondary locations based on a gravity model, realistic routing for active, public, and private motorised modes of transportation and allows users to introduce new buildings and amenities if needed. The model aims to impute national-level mobility patterns from a household travel survey and apply them locally to capture the nuances of a neighbourhood's built environment and demographic composition.},

	abstract = {Large-scale agent-based microsimulation platforms, increasingly used in transportation demand modelling, require fully enumerated and spatialized lists of the population and its sociodemographic characteristics as input. The quality of the synthetic population, measured as its ability to reproduce the sociodemographic characteristics of the real population and their spatial distributions, is thus a determinant factor of the model reliability. While many efforts were devoted to improving the sociodemographic accuracy of synthetic populations, less attention was paid to perfecting their spatial precision. Conventional spatialized population synthesis methods, where the generation and spatialization processes are separated, are vulnerable to inconsistencies between zonal synthetic populations, and the built environments on which they are then distributed. These methods also present transferability issues that lie in their high reliance on rich spatialized datasets and knowledge of the local context. Hence, we propose an integrated multiresolution framework (IMF) that overcomes the limitations of the conventional framework (CF) by its ability to directly generate synthetic populations at the building resolution with minimal data requirements. The IMF includes an extension of an optimization-based method to multiresolution applications where any number and aggregation of spatial resolutions can efficiently be controlled. The CF and the IMF are applied to generate synthetic populations for Montreal, Canada. We define and measure sociodemographic accuracy, spatial precision, overall quality, and building-resolution fit of the synthetic populations to compare the frameworks’ performances. Despite a small loss in accuracy, the IMF achieves drastically better spatial precision, overall quality and building-resolution fit of synthetic populations, compared to the CF.},

	abstract = {In this study, an activity-based travel demand model of the Ústí nad Labem district (Czech Republic) is created. To do this, an advanced travel demand synthesis process is presented by utilizing the Eqasim framework, which is a pipeline-processing, initial raw data to simulation step. The framework is extensively modified and extended with several algorithms in order to utilize multiple data points for increasing realism in mobility for travel demand models. Two major extensions are provided. First, the pipeline framework is improved to estimate inbound and outbound trips of the study area, comprising a main city and 23 surrounding municipalities. The extended framework assigns synthetic gates for the study area as hubs for the inclusion of inbound and outbound trips. Second, the pipeline framework is advanced to provide a more compatible match of travel destination and activity location state. To do this, the extended framework assigns a capacity for each facility identified for the study area, the expected number of visitors to each facility, and the number of residents in each building. The resulting demand model is presented and the generated trips are evaluated based on locational, transport mode, and sociodemographic characteristics with origin–destination (OD) bundling. Additionally, distribution analyses of the present model are conducted to understand the matching results on a detailed level. The results demonstrate that the present model provides a reasonable output for transport researchers when testing different mobility scenarios and the provided extensions helps them to reduce implausible reflections of the distribution of travel and activity characteristics in household travel surveys while creating demand models, thus increasing realism. Lastly, open-source playground and code repository for further future improvement of synthetic travel synthesis methods are created, which enhances a deep understanding of the preparatory and methodological backgrounds required for complex activity-based simulations in order to inspire transport planners.},

	abstract = {Human mobility plays a crucial role in transportation, urban planning, and public health. Advances in deep learning and the availability of diverse mobility data have transformed mobility modeling. However, existing deep learning models often focus on spatio-temporal patterns and struggle to capture the semantic interdependencies among activities, while also being limited by specific data sources. These challenges reduce their realism and adaptability. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs) face issues as well, relying on rigid assumptions and requiring extensive data, making them costly and difficult to adapt to new regions, especially those with limited conventional travel data. To address these limitations, we develop a novel generative deep learning approach for human mobility modeling and synthesis that incorporates both activity patterns and location trajectories using open-source data. The model can be fine-tuned with local data, allowing it to adapt to and accurately represent mobility patterns across diverse regions. The model is evaluated on a nationwide dataset of the United States, where it demonstrates superior performance in generating activity-location chains that closely follow ground truth distributions. Further tests using state- or city-specific datasets from California, Washington, and Mexico City confirm its transferability. This innovative approach offers substantial potential to advance mobility modeling research, particularly in generating synthetic human mobility data. This can provide urban planners and policymakers with enhanced tools for simulating mobility in diverse regions and better informing decisions related to transportation, urban development, and public health.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the activity-travel behaviour literature that employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques for empirical analysis and modelling. Machine Learning algorithms, which attempt to build intelligence utilizing the availability of large amounts of data, have emerged as powerful tools in the fields of pattern recognition and big data analysis. These techniques have been applied in activity-travel behaviour studies since the early ’90s when Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were employed to model mode choice decisions. AMOS, an activity-based modelling system developed in the mid-’90s, has ANN at its core to model and predict individual responses to travel demand management measures. In the dawn of 2000, ALBATROSS, a comprehensive activity-based travel demand modelling system, was proposed by Arentze and Timmermans using Decision Trees. Since then researchers have been exploring ML techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Neural Networks (NN), Bayes Classifiers, and more recently, Ensemble Learners to model and predict activity-travel behaviour. A large number of publications over the years and an upward trend in the number of published articles over time indicate that Machine Learning is a promising tool for activity-travel behaviour analysis and prediction. This article, first of its kind in the literature, reviews these studies and explores the trends in activity-travel behaviour research that apply ML techniques. The review finds that mode choice decisions have received wide attention in the literature on ML applications. It was observed that most of the studies identify the lack of interpretability as a serious shortcoming in ML techniques. However, very few studies have attempted to improve the interpretability of the models. Further, some studies report the importance of feature engineering in ML-based studies, but very few studies adopt feature engineering before model development. Spatiotemporal transferability of models is another issue that has received minimal attention in the literature. In the end, the paper discusses possible directions for future research in the area of activity-travel behaviour modelling using ML techniques.},

We show, via this framework and different metrics for the analysis of the generated distribution of the individuals’ attributes, that population synthesizers may fail to correctly replicate the real population heterogeneity owing to diverse control variables, data limitations, and post-simulation computation of certain parameter distributions. To show these shortcomings, the authors propose a systematic classification of different types of distributions crucial for mobility simulations. The proposed framework aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the population and serve as a rapid ’debugging’ tool to identify and rectify any flaws in a specific population during the calibration of the activity-based mobility simulation models. To prove the effectiveness of this framework, we applied it to synthetic populations generated through MOBIUS (mobility optimization based on iterative user synthesis), a newly developed synthetic population generator, which in this case was employed to create different variants of the Luxembourg population (1\%, 10\%, 30\%). The application of our framework to these populations not only provided an effective method for assessing their goodness of fit, but also helped highlight the distributions that are most critical to the successful implementation of the methodology.},

Then we design a decision model that describes when a person would choose to work in a shared office, and which transport mode they would use. We finally perform an optimization to maximize the gains in terms of traveled distance using a linear solver and heuristic methods, and compare their respective effectiveness. The results are encouraging, since they show that using an optimized network computed with our method, we could reduce the total car commuting distance by 23\%, which represents a reduction in carbon emissions of hundreds of tons per day at the scale of the studied use case region around Toulouse.},

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper introduces an innovative approach to assess the effects of traffic policies using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). By incorporating complex transport network structures directly into the neural network, this approach could enable rapid testing of various policies without the delays associated with traditional simulations. We provide a proof of concept that GNNs can learn and predict changes in car volume resulting from capacity reduction policies. We train a GNN model based on a training set generated with a MATSim simulation for Paris, France. We analyze the model's performance across different road types and scenarios, finding that the GNN is generally able to learn the effects on edge-based traffic volume induced by policies. The model is especially successful in predicting changes on major streets. Nevertheless, the evaluation also showed that the current model has problems in predicting impacts of spatially small policies and changes in traffic volume in regions where no policy is applied due to spillovers and/or relocation of traffic.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of urban transportation can be captured using activity-based models, which rely on travel demand data to get a comprehensive understanding of urban mobility. This data is usually derived from population samples and Household Travel Surveys (HTSs), which can be expensive and as a result, are conducted only every 5 to 10 years. Moreover, due to their limited reach, they are not adapted to represent the spatio-temporal structure of the flows of the total population. This calls for complementary data sources that could be used to update old surveys to cut costs and to estimate the global spatial mobility behavior of the population. In this paper, we propose steps in the state-of-the-art pipeline for travel demand synthesis with an approach for the temporal calibration and the location attribution based on time-dependent origin–destination (OD) matrices. These matrices describe the flows between zones of a city. This methodology is illustrated on the city of Lyon, France, with OD matrices estimated from the mobile phone activity of the subscribers of French telecom operator Orange. We explore how the spatialization can be performed using various probabilistic graph models whose parameters are evaluated via the OD matrices. The structure of the models enforces the consistency of the locations with the chains of activities, such as the fact that two “home” activities must have the same location. Multiple models are proposed, corresponding to different compromises between the two potentially incompatible sources that are HTS and mobile data. We show that while a very naive spatialization approach allows the generation of synthetic travel demand that perfectly fits the flows described by the OD matrices without respecting the consistency of the locations, the other proposed approaches offer much more realistic agendas at the expense of only small discrepancies with the mobile data.},

The study is based on the agent-based traffic simulation framework MATSim and covers the whole process from the implementation of the transport mode, several extensions of existing MATSim assets and the simulation results. It has been found that the introduced AVs are mainly competing with established public transport services and that the net driven distance by cars in the network is increased.

	abstract = {Self-driving cars and their deployment as a transport service have been studied extensively in the Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) concept. Increasingly, more specific use cases and deployment scenarios are studied in the literature. One of those concepts are CCAM Airport Access Services (CCAMAAS) that may facilitate and robustify first and last mile access to airports by the use of automated shuttles. Our goal is to gain insights into the operational benefits and challenges of such services, as well as on their economic and ecological impact. The paper presents a first step towards a novel simulation-based assessment framework for such services, by introducing a first use case example of a comparative analysis between classic taxi services and CCAMAAS for the Paris CDG and ORY airports.},

	abstract = {In many cities, shared micromobility services (SMMS) have become popular. These services contribute to the popularity of car-alternative mobility by promoting the use of micro-vehicles. Bike-sharing and e-scooter-sharing systems are examples of these services. Despite their potential, the share of SMMS is still marginal. To unlock their full potential, policymakers and service providers need to comprehend the wider implications of their strategies on the adoption, use, and profitability of these services. This paper investigates the implications on travel demand, use patterns, and business profit of two strategic decisions: the size of the fleet and the pricing of shared bikes and e-scooters. This research is based on an agent-based transport simulation framework and trip records of shared bike and e-scooter users from the city of Lyon, France. The results show that despite their actual marginal share, SMMS have a non-negligible growth potential in Lyon. This potential is unfulfilled due to sub-optimal pricing and fleet size strategies. In the paper, more optimal strategies are discussed from the point of view of service providers and customers. These findings can be generalized to other cities and shared micromobility services. They can also be of interest to policymakers and service providers in the design and operation of successful and efficient SMMS.},

	abstract = {On-demand ride-pooling systems have gained increasing attention in science and practice in recent years. Simulation studies have shown an enormous potential to reduce fleet sizes and vehicle kilometers traveled if private car trips are replaced with ride-pooling services. However, existing simulation studies assume operation with autonomous vehicles, with no restrictions on operational tasks required when the vehicles are operated by manual drivers. In this article, we simulate and evaluate the operational challenges of non-autonomous ride-pooling systems through driver shifts and breaks and compare their capacity and efficiency to autonomous on-demand services. Based on the existing ride-pooling service MOIA in Hamburg, Germany, we introduce shift and break schedules and implement a new hub return logic to perform the respective tasks at different types of vehicle hubs. This way, currently operating on-demand services are modeled more realistically and the efficiency gains of such services through autonomous vehicles are quantified. The results suggest that operational challenges substantially limit the ride-pooling capacity in terms of served rides with a given number of vehicles. While results largely depend on the chosen shift plan, the presented operational factors should be considered for the assessment of current operational real-world services. The contribution of this study is threefold: From a technical perspective, it is shown that the explicit simulation of operational constraints of current services is crucial to assess ride-pooling services. From a policy perspective, the study shows the operational challenges of a ride-pooling service with non-autonomous vehicles and the potential of future autonomous services. Lastly, the paper adds to the literature a practical ride-pooling simulation use case based on observed real-world demand and shift data.},

	abstract = {Populations in cities are constantly increasing, which puts more stress on existing transportation systems and especially public transport lines. A good example of this is the situation in the Île-de-France (IdF) region around Paris. There, the Grand Paris Express (GPE), a new system of major rail-based public transport lines, is planned to be introduced to complement the existing offer by connecting the suburban areas of Paris without having to go through the center of the capital city. These new lines are expected to be put in service progressively from 2024 to 2030. Along with additional tram-based lines, they are expected to significantly reduce travel time for some parts of the population. In this work, we adopt an agent-based simulation approach in which a synthetic population of IdF with activity chains of is generated. The population is then fed to the simulation with the currently existing public transportation offer as well as the future lines that we consider. The impact of the new offer is evaluated on a subset of the IdF area. We find that future rail-based public transport lines will not only impact existing rail lines but also majorly impact the bus lines which are rendered less attractive in comparison. However, ridership of certain bus lines is greatly increased. Moreover, we assess the potential of using a Mobility-on-Demand feeder service to increase accessibility to rail-based modes. Results show that such a service increases the ridership of related transport lines, while bus trips are decreased. We measure the performance of the Mobility-on-Demand system under different fleet settings. This research is fully reproducible as we solely make use of fully open data, tools and methodologies. We identify development pathways that will be investigated further in future works for a more comprehensive assessment of future transportation systems in IdF.},

	abstract = {Methodologies relying on agent-based simulation are increasingly used in mobility studies and The MATSim framework is a popular open-source tools used by researchers. Often, the objective is to assess a mobility solution on a small area, for which simulating the mobility of the whole surrounding region appears disproportionate, since the run times increase with the size of the population and the study area. To address this issue, a procedure for cutting out specific areas from a MATSim simulation scenario is available and regularly used by the community. However, despite speeding-up simulations, the existing approach comes with limitations that do not allow to fully estimate the impact of new mobility services in the area of interest. In the paper at hand, we propose a new simulation scenario-cutting procedure that alleviates the limitations of the previous one in terms of the capacity to assess the modal shift induced by changes of mobility configuration. Our approach is evaluated on a case-study involving the introduction of an on-demand mobility system in a rural area of the Île-de-France region. Comparisons against the already existing method, as well as running a full simulation of the whole region, show conclusive results. Our approach is able to better estimate the impact of new services on traveller decisions, achieving results that are significantly closer to the full simulation than the previous method. The simulation platform, the implementation of our approach as well as the data required used to build the scenarios are openly available, making this research fully reproducible.},

	abstract = {Roads in mesoscopic traffic simulation models are often parametrized by a free speed attribute, which describes the speed at which a vehicle can traverse a road in the absence of congestion. Unlike microscopic models, mesoscopic models do not typically simulate traffic lights, individual driver behavior or acceleration and deceleration of vehicles. In consequence, the free speed parameter of each road must account for all the aforementioned effects. Modeling free speed accurately is important, as it determines the travel time, which in turn affects the decision-making of agents in the simulation. This paper introduces an approach combining microscopic simulation with machine learning models to estimate road segment free speeds. Using the microscopic simulator SUMO, we generate training data for a model search employing Bayesian optimization. Subsequently, these models undergo fine-tuning via gradient-based optimization using real-world point-to-point travel times. A significant advantage is the adaptability of this approach to diverse road networks, including those from OpenStreetMap, and the ability to incorporate routing data from various online providers independently. Our evaluation illustrates a notable decrease in prediction error between 30\% and 60\% compared to baseline models that assume a uniform free speed reduction for all urban roads. The fine-tuned models are able to generalize well to unseen regions and are therefore applicable to case studies where data for new or altered roads is unavailable.},

In this paper, we argue that, under awareness about the available resource and other users demands, a cooperative setting has to be considered in order to revisit and adapt the concept of fairness. Such a complete information sharing setting is expected to happen in 5G environments, where resource sharing among tenants (slices) need to be made acceptable by users and applications, which therefore need to be better informed about the system status via ad-hoc (northbound) interfaces than in legacy environments. We identify in the individual satisfaction rates the key aspect of the challenge of defining a new notion of fairness in systems with complete information sharing, consequently, a more appropriate resource allocation algorithm. We generalize the concept of user satisfaction considering the set of admissible solutions for bankruptcy games and we adapt to it the fairness indices. Accordingly, we propose a new allocation rule we call mood value: for each user, it equalizes our novel game-theoretic definition of user satisfaction with respect to a distribution of the resource. We test the mood value and a new fairness index through extensive simulations about the cellular frequency scheduling use-case, showing how they better support the fairness analysis. We complete the paper with further analysis on the behavior of the mood value in the presence of multiple competing providers and with cheating users.},

	abstract = {Simulation may serve to assess the consequences of operational decisions in a complex hybrid Supply Chain (HSC) that connects an unlimited number of continuous (CP) and discrete processes (DP). Modelling and simulation of such HSC cannot be adequately achieved using commercially available software based on Discrete Events Simulation (DES), System Dynamic Simulation (SDS) or Agent-Based simulation (ABS). The hybrid simulation path (HS), which combines two of these simulation approaches, has not been found to deliver adequate modelling of a HSC and simulation of the impact of a set of operational decisions whose consequences are felt in the short term (within a few weeks). This diagnosis, supported by a review of many recent papers and surveys, led us away from the HS path. To overcome the modelling issues to be addressed, as further discussed below, we developed an extension of DES comprising a set of four generic components, made up of basic components (stocks and processors). These are easily implemented in most commercial DES software. To best describe the methodological issues involved and our proposed solution, we provide an example of a major chemical plant where our solution was successfully implemented.},

Household decisions integrate personal impacts (quality, cost), perceived consequences (climate change, human responsibility), and social norms. The evaluation of these different criteria relies on household beliefs, which can be exchanged during social interactions. These beliefs can be used to explain household decisions on a macro and micro scale, and thus to target information or incentive policies. The model is applied to dietary choice in France, among the omnivorous diet (INCA3), the flexitarian diet and the vegetarian diet. In the control simulation, we observe a significant increase in the proportion of flexitarians, and a slight increase in the proportion of vegetarians over 5 years. We also illustrate the need to properly inform households with the emergence of fake news.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of fairly and efficiently allocating resources to agents. We consider a specific setting, usually referred to as a housing market, where each agent must receive exactly one resource (and initially owns one). In this framework, in the domain of linear preferences, the Top Trading Cycle (TTC) algorithm is the only procedure satisfying Pareto-optimality, individual rationality and strategy-proofness. Under the restriction of single-peaked preferences, Crawler enjoys the same properties. These two centralized procedures might however involve long trading cycles. In this paper we focus instead on procedures involving the shortest cycles: bilateral swap-deals. In such swap dynamics, the agents perform pairwise mutually improving deals until reaching a swap-stable allocation (no improving swap-deal is possible). We prove that in the single-peaked domain every swap-stable allocation is Pareto-optimal, showing the efficiency of the swap dynamics. In fact, this domain turns out to be maximal when it comes to guaranteeing this property. Besides, both the outcome of TTC and Crawler can always be reached by sequences of swaps. However, some Pareto-optimal allocations are not reachable through improving swap-deals. We further analyze the outcome of swap dynamics through social welfare notions, in our context the average or minimum rank of the resources obtained by agents in the final allocation. We start by providing a worst-case analysis of these procedures. Finally, we present an extensive experimental study in which different versions of swap dynamics are compared to other existing allocation procedures. We show that they exhibit good results on average in this domain, under different cultures for generating synthetic data.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an upsurge in intelligent mobility solutions that provide door-to-door services. Although these services offer convenience to certain individuals, it is frequently overlooked that they can lead to welfare losses when accounting for the reduced health benefits that result from reduced physical activity. In this paper, we derive a welfare function of introducing first- and last-mile public transport services. By comparing possible health gains from walking with corresponding accessibility losses, we identify the distance boundaries under which the service fails to be socially beneficial. The results are based on a simulation study and draw on further insights from a recent agent-based model from Copenhagen focusing on first- and last-mile public transport. Although the model is intentionally stylized and may not apply universally to all scenarios featuring diverse population densities, demographic profiles, or transport network layouts, the fundamental conclusion presented in the paper is that first-mile services have minimal welfare impact for average trip distances below 1 km, appears robust even under conservative assumptions. In this case, the probability of failure is almost 100\% for any realistic parametrization. This finding implies that planners and researchers should focus on the design of main transit networks and the access and egress of active modes to and from the stations. In particular, door-to-door services covering shorter distances should not be the priority of public funding unless in particular situations or contexts.},

	abstract = {Sustainable and active urban mobility options, such as walking, represent a significant opportunity for achieving environmentally friendly and healthier transportation in the Paris Region. Despite the well-known benefits of walking on mental and physical health, there is a need to substantiate the potential gains that could be brought by supporting the development of walking as a transport mode in the eyes of public authorities at different governmental levels. Our research aims to analyze and model the potential impacts of economic incentives on walking behavior in the Paris Region. We do so by addressing the research problem of how these strategies can effectively encourage individuals to choose walking as a mode of transportation. Also, we look at how the modal shift would impact the use of Public Transport (PT), walking, bike, and private car. We propose to tackle the topic through a quantitative modeling exercise where the impact of financial incentives for walking is assessed in detail by using agent-based modeling and simulations of 36 different incentive scenarios. In our simulations, travelers' behavior is modeled and considered individually, and a mode choice model is used to approximate real-life user decision-making. Such a model takes into account different components of a trip, such as duration and cost. In this work, a representative simulation of the Île de France area and the underlying mode choice model are extended to test the incentive policies for walking. Various incentive scenarios are studied, and, by integrating the incentives in the mode choice model, we can assess each scenario's impact on user decisions. This study sheds light on potential strategies that decision-makers and other stakeholders in the region's ecosystem could take to achieve multisectoral sustainable goals using economic incentives for walking to encourage more sustainable mobility.},

A challenge often faced by transportation professionals is to accurately expand the survey households to represent the population. The problem becomes even more complicated when dealing with household travel surveys, because the goal is to find household weights such that the distributions of the characteristics in the weighted sample not only match given distributions of households but also those of persons. This paper presents an Entropy Maximization methodology to estimate household survey weights to match the exogenously given distributions of the population, including both households and persons. The paper also presents a Relaxed Formulation to deal with cases when constraints are not feasible and convergence is not achieved. The methodology is applied to a large geography - Maricopa County region, Arizona, and a small geography – blockgroup, and estimation results are presented. Estimation results show that the Strict Formulation can be used to estimate the weights when constraints imposed by distributions of population characteristics are feasible. Relaxed formulation can be used to estimate weights when the constraints are infeasible such that distributions of the population characteristics are satisfied to within reasonable limits.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework to tackle the problem, which has received little attention in the literature, of adding variables to a synthetic population from aggregate data. The work herein thus enriches the existing literature by proposing a new and e icient methodology to meet this practical need. The methodology integrates three distinct stages, the first of which theoretically models the problem as a multinomial distribution. The addition of a new variable is formulated as an entropy maximization using the variables available in both the synthetic population and aggregate data. Solving this problem (in our specific case study) is not possible due to the large number of constraints involved. The second stage then presents a heuristic yielding a practical solution to the problem. This heuristic combines Bayes' theorem with the cross-entropy minimization algorithm. However, given the large number of parameters to be estimated by the proposed heuristic, some of the results obtained prove to be invalid. To rectify this shortcoming, a post-processing method is applied during a third stage to ensure the consistency of our results. The methodology is described in great detail, and examples are provided for a better understanding of these three stages. Also, this methodology is applied to a real-world case study. An income is allocated to each of the 157 000 households in the French city of Nantes based on aggregate data from the FiLoSoFi database. Income constitutes an essential microsimulation variable for taking many social and economic aspects into account (e.g. household purchasing power, redistribution policy, tax policy). Special attention is also paid to the reproducibility of our results with the databases and R-scripts used, all of which are freely available. This method remains general and is indeed applicable to other variables with available aggregate data.},

Increasing attention is being paid to DRT (Demand Responsive Transportation) services that enable the bundling of trips with the help of dynamic routing algorithms. Many providers use a stop-based operating concept for this purpose. The transport between so-called virtual stops promises a higher fraction of shared trips and shorter vehicle detours. The aim of this paper is to investigate multiple stop network designs and their impacts on the efficiency of the operation. For this purpose, three stop network generation approaches were derived from literature and applied to the simulation environment MATSim. A scenario in the city center of Berlin is simulated, where all inner car trips are replaced by DRT. Comparing the stop network design against a door-to-door service, the results suggest a trade-off between a reduction of vehicle kilometers (up to 18\%) and increased walking distances (up to 250 meters on average).},

We show theoretically that the general problem becomes more complex (as it contains two sub-problems that extend set-cover), analyze the trade-offs that emerge, and provide a general formulation and specific heuristics that are able to solve it over large instances. We test this formulation over a real dataset of Manhattan taxi trips (9970 requests during one hour), finding that (a) average walks of about one minute can reduce the number of rejections in more than 80\% and Vehicles-Hour-Traveled in more than 10\%, (b) users who depart or arrive at the most demanded areas are more likely to be required to walk, and (c) the performance improvement of the service is larger when the system receives more trip requests.},

These data are usually derived from small population samples and surveys, which may be expensive and do not adequately cover the spatial trajectories of the users. In this paper, we explore the use of a time-dependent origin-destination (OD) matrix derived from mobile phone data for the attribution of locations in a synthetic population for the city of Lyon, France. OD matrix data can also mitigate uncertainties or outdated information in travel surveys regarding flows by time of day and between zones. The resulting population enrichment is measured in terms of fit to the input mobility data.},

While many cities are promoting cycling, it is rarely included in transport models and systematic policy evaluation procedures. The purpose of this study is to extend the agent-based transport simulation framework MATSim to take into account attributes of the infrastructure that are relevant for cycling and the decisions that cyclists take. It is shown that meaningful simulation results are obtained for both an illustrative test scenario and a Berlin scenario. Further attributes (e.g. personal or bicycle-related attributes) that have an effect on the behavior of cyclists can be included into the simulation and, by this, into policy evaluation. Based on the exclusive reliance on open data, the approach is transferable to other spatial contexts.},

The MOBIS study was a nation-wide randomised controlled trial (RCT) of transport pricing in Switzerland, utilising a combination of postal recruitment, online surveys, and GPS tracking. 21,571 persons completed the first online survey, and 3680 persons completed 8 weeks of GPS tracking. Many continued tracking for over a year after the study was completed. In the field experiment, participants participated through the use of a GPS tracking app, Catch-my-Day, which logged their daily travel on different transport modes and imputed the trip segments and modes. The experiment lasted 8 weeks, bookended by two online surveys. After the first 4-week control phase, participants were split into two different treatment groups and a continued control group. An analysis of the survey participation shows that the technology is capable of supporting such an experiment on both Android and iOS, the two main mobile platforms. Significant differences in the engagement and attrition were observed between iOS and Android participants over the 8-week period. Finally, the attrition rate did not vary between treatment groups. This paper also reports on the wealth of data that are being made available for further research, which includes over 3 million trip stages and activities, labelled with transport mode and purpose respectively.},

However, the existing simulation models for e-commerce demand are still limited and do not consider the impacts of delivery options and their attributes that shoppers face on multiple dimensions of e-commerce demand. We propose a novel framework involving disaggregate behavioral models that jointly predict e-commerce expenditure, purchase amount per transaction, delivery mode, and option choices. The proposed framework can simulate the changes in e-commerce demand and be used to evaluate the impacts of a range of policies and solutions. We specify the model parameters based on various sources of relevant information, integrate the model into an urban freight simulator, and conduct a demonstrative simulation for a prototypical North American city. The results of the analysis highlight the capability and applicability of the proposed modeling framework.},

This study proposes a simulation-based methodology to investigate the execution of freight tours with an On-Demand fleet of autonomous, modular vehicles while giving priority to passenger transport. Based on assumptions regarding the operational scheme, tour pricing and delivery time windows, the software Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) is extended. The developed methodology is then applied to a Berlin-wide freight delivery scenario. The results show that when using a relatively large vehicle fleet, passenger waiting time statistics barely change. However, it has to be noted that the study should be repeated with different (smaller) fleet sizes. A rough cost analysis for the freight operator suggests that there is a large saving potential when using autonomous On-Demand vehicles instead of an owned fleet. Because of the uncertainty of price composition, further studies to quantify this saving potential have to be made.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the integration of freight delivery into the passenger transport of an on-demand ride-pooling service. The goal of this research is to use existing passenger trips for logistics services and thus reduce additional vehicle kilometers for freight delivery and the total number of vehicles on the road network. This is achieved by merging the need for two separate fleets into a single one by combining the services. This research provides an extensive literature review and discusses policy measures supporting such a service. To evaluate the potential of such a mobility-on-demand service, this paper uses an agent-based simulation framework and integrates three heuristic parcel assignment strategies into a ride-pooling fleet control algorithm. Two integration scenarios (moderate and full) are set up. While in both scenarios passengers and parcels share rides in one vehicle, in the moderate scenario no stops for parcel pick-up and delivery are allowed during a passenger ride to decrease customer inconvenience. Using real-world demand data for a case study of Munich, Germany, the two integration scenarios together with the three assignment strategies are compared to the status quo, which uses two separate vehicle fleets for passenger and logistics transport. The results indicate that the integration of logistics services into a ride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacities without deteriorating passenger transportation. Depending on the assignment strategies nearly all parcels can be served until a parcel to passenger demand ratio of 1:10 while the overall fleet kilometers can be decreased compared to the status quo.},

The chief conclusion is that the accuracy of freight generation (FG) and freight trip generation (FTG) models depends on the consistency between the model's structure and actual FG-FTG patterns, the degree of internal heterogeneity of the economic and land use aggregation used to estimate the model, and the appropriateness of the spatial aggregation procedure used to obtain the desired FG-FTG estimates. Relative to model structure, the paper establishes strong reasons to treat FG and FTG as separate concepts, because the latter is the output of logistic decisions, whereas the former is determined by the economics of production and consumption. The connection between business size variables–for example, employment–and FG is relatively strong because they are economic input factors, whereas the one with FTG is weaker because inventory and transportation costs come into play. Thus it is generally not correct to assume proportionality between FTG and business size or to assume that using constant FTG rates could be problematic. For instance, only 18\% of the industry sectors in New York City exhibit constant FTG rates per employee. For economic and land use aggregation, the finer the level of detail the better, as independent variables have a better chance to explain FG-FTG. In the case of spatial aggregation, the correct aggregation procedure depends on the underlying disaggregate model. For a FG-FTG model to work well, both economic and land use and spatial aggregations must be appropriate.},

	abstract = {Trip-based models and activity-based models represent two extreme ends of the spectrum of travel demand models in data granularity requirement and ability to reflect the underlying motivation to travel. Modelling of representative freight activity-travel patterns (RFAPs) has the potential to serve as the bridge between these approaches. RFAP clusters represent homogeneous groups of establishments, where utility maximization models predict the probability that an establishment belongs to a particular cluster. However, it is still an open question how to define, interpret and model activity-travel patterns in the context of freight system. To answer this question, this study conducted a large-scale establishment-based freight survey (EBFS) in seven cities of India and resulted in a sample of 432 establishments and their 1613 shipment records. In the first part, this paper proposes a novel approach for identifying RFAPs based on the notion that “activities” that inspire trip-making for passenger is equivalent to “freight orders” in the case of establishments. The cluster analyses revealed the presence of three well separated main clusters and nine less separated nested clusters. Through interpretation and labelling of these RFAPs, freight travel market is categorized into useful segments. The results suggested that a priori industrial classification systems used in trip-based models are overly simplified representations of the complex structure of the travel patterns. In the last part, freight activity-travel pattern generation (FAPG) models are developed which predicts the probability that an establishment exhibits a particular RFAP. The FAPG models developed using these RFAPs could replace the traditional freight generation (FG) and freight trip generation (FTG) models due to its ability to convert the assigned activity-patterns to trips or tonnage. For example, FAPG model suggest that at an employment level of 120, there is a 56\% probability that establishments will exhibit MDV-HFMH (medium duty vehicles - high frequency medium haul) pattern which, in turn, implies that FP = 1630 tons/year; shipment frequency, i.e., FTP = 8 trips/week; length of haul = 240.6 km and commercial vehicle type choice = MDV. Thus, FAPG models can present an enhanced representation of freight flows since both FG and FTG are jointly modeled in this approach. That is, the best features of both commodity-based modelling (i.e., ability to capture the fundamental mechanism that drives freight demand) and vehicle-based modelling (i.e., ability to capture freight traffic implications) are included in FAPG models. The study findings are expected to assist in identifying the variations in establishments’ preferences so that it is possible to identify the type of transport supply improvements that the establishments will respond to accurately, and thus prioritize the infrastructure investments. Moreover, the discussions on these findings are expected to improve the behavioral and spatial foundations of traditional freight models.},

	abstract = {Freight transport demand is a demand derived from all the activities needed to move goods between locations of production to locations of consumption, including trade, logistics and transportation. A good representation of logistics in freight transport demand models allows us to predict the effects of changes in logistics systems on future transport flows. As such it provides better estimations of the costs of interaction and allows to predict changes in spatial patterns of freight transport flows more accurately. In recent years, the attention for freight modelling has been growing and new research work has appeared aimed at incorporating logistics in freight models. In this paper we review the state of the art in the representation of logistics considerations in freight transport demand models. Our focus is on the service and cost drivers of changes in logistics networks and how these affect freight transport. Our review proceeds along a conceptual framework for modelling that goes beyond the conventional 4-step modelling approach. We identify promising areas for freight modelling that have an integrative function within this framework, such as spatial computable general equilibrium models, supply chain choice models and hypernetwork models.},

In view of this, an effort has been made to synthesize the available literature related to modelling of trip generation rates. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies related to impact of land use on trip rates, data collection techniques and modelling approaches. Major challenges associated with modelling of trip generation includes the unavailability of standard reference databases for multimodal trip generation, consideration of land use evolvement, less explored machine learning modelling approaches, and the feasibility of using emerging data collection techniques in travel surveys. Finally, a framework is proposed for modelling multimodal trip generation rates considering the above identified issues.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of the e-commerce market leads us to expect a further increase in delivery vehicles in urban areas as well. This growth is expected to be accompanied by an increase in emissions while space becomes scarce. Meanwhile, people are adjusting their travel behaviour; therefore, the growing e-commerce market affects both last-mile delivery and private passenger traffic. Failed home deliveries are an important factor. They produce additional traffic by both ”Courier, Express and Parcel” (CEP) service providers and private passengers in the form of repeated delivery attempts or trips to pick up parcels. In this paper we apply an integrated agent-based model of last-mile deliveries and private travel demand. This allows for analysis of interactions between delivery and private passenger traffic and the status of the recipients during delivery. Furthermore, we present a neighbourship model to account for deliveries accepted by neighbours, which is crucial to reproduce realistic delivery success rates. We applied the presented model to the city of Karlsruhe, Germany, and simulated multiple delivery policy scenarios, which we compare to a static model without interactions between private and delivery agents. Our results show that the agent-based model produces more nuanced success rates with respect to different socio-demographic groups. Differentiating these groups is necessary when assessing measures that target specific groups and analysing effects of demographic changes. Also, we show the necessity of considering neighbours in such a model. This paper provides insight into the effects of e-commerce on a transport system and a framework to analyse policy measures or alternative delivery strategies.},

	abstract = {Recently, a substantial increase in parcel volumes has been observable, primarily shipped by courier, express, and parcel service providers (CEPSPs). Especially in urban areas, existing space conflicts are intensified, while emissions are steadily rising due to the higher need of parcel transportation. From a regional planning perspective, understanding the net effect of increased parcel volumes is essential for transportation planning and policies, for which freight demand models are commonly used. Existing models primarily focus on parcel deliveries to private customers, although parcel shipments to and from companies considerably contribute to the overall parcel volumes. Hence, this study aims to develop an agent-based model that explicitly represents the in- and outgoing parcel volumes of companies in urban areas delivered by CEPSPs. An approach based on Open Data and self-conducted expert interviews with CEPSPs is developed. First, OpenStreetMap data is used to geographically represent companies with the corresponding sector assignment within a study area in Karlsruhe, Germany. Second, a concept for modeling the weekly in- and outgoing parcel volume for each company in the study area is developed using literature-based data. The approach is integrated into the existing agent-based framework logiTopp considering all relevant CEPSPs of the respective area. The application shows that modeling CEP-based transportation volumes of companies based on Open Data is possible though restrictions apply to the granularity of the used data. However, potential is seen in generating a well-funded empirical database of companies’ in- and outgoing parcel demand structures to improve the model further.},

We propose a novel framework involving disaggregate behavioral models that jointly predict e-commerce expenditure, purchase amount per transaction, delivery mode, and option choices. The proposed framework can simulate the changes in e-commerce demand and be used to evaluate the impacts of a range of policies and solutions. We specify the model parameters based on various sources of relevant information, integrate the model into an urban freight simulator, and conduct a demonstrative simulation for a prototypical North American city.

As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors’ business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas. Finally, the decision support system is tested using real data of the city of Turin.},

	abstract = {Better understanding of the complex links between urban transportation, land use, air quality, and population exposure is needed to improve urban sustainability. A goal of this study was to develop an exposure modeling framework that integrates agent-based activity and travel simulation with air pollution modeling for Tampa, Florida. We aimed to characterize exposure and exposure inequality for traffic-related air pollution, and to investigate the impacts of high-resolution information on estimated exposure. To do these, we developed and applied a modeling framework that combines the DaySim activity-based travel demand model, the MATSim dynamic traffic assignment model, the MOVES mobile source emissions estimator, and the R-LINE dispersion model. Resulting spatiotemporal distributions of daily individual human activity and pollutant concentration were matched to analyze population and subgroup exposure to oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from passenger car travel for an average winter day in 2010. Four scenarios using data with different spatiotemporal resolutions were considered: a) high resolution for both activities and concentrations, b) low resolution for both activities and concentrations, c) high resolution for activities, but low resolution for concentrations, and d) vice versa. For the high-resolution scenario, the mean daily population exposure concentration of NOx from passenger cars was 10.2 μg/m3; individual exposure concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 145 μg/m3. Subgroup mean exposure was higher than the population mean for individuals living below-poverty (by {\textasciitilde}16\%), those with daily travel time over one hour (8\%), adults aged 19–45 (7\%), blacks (6\%), Hispanics (4\%), Asians (2\%), combined other non-white races (2\%), people from middle income households (2\%), and residents of urban areas (2\%). The subgroup inequality index (a measure of disparity) largely increased with concentration up to the 90th percentile level for these groups. At higher levels, disparities increased sharply for individuals from below poverty households, blacks, and Hispanics. Low-resolution simulation of both activities and concentrations decreased the exposure estimates by 10\% on average, with differences ranging from eight times higher to {\textasciitilde}90\% lower.},

	abstract = {Transportation modeling and simulation play an important role in the planning and management of emergency evacuation. It is often indispensable for the preparedness and timely response to extreme events occurring in highly populated areas. Reliable and robust agent-based evacuation models are of great importance to support evacuation decision making. Nevertheless, these models rely on numerous hypothetical causal relationships between the evacuation behavior and a variety of factors including socio-economic characteristics and storm intensity. Understanding the impacts of these factors on evacuation behaviors (e.g., destination and route choices) is crucial in preparing optimal evacuation plans. This paper aims to contribute to the literature by integrating well-calibrated behavior models with an agent-based evacuation simulation model in the context of hurricane evacuation. Specifically, discrete choice models were developed to estimate the evacuation behaviors based on large-scale survey data in Northern New Jersey. Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling method was used to estimate evacuation propensity and destination choices for the whole population. Finally, evacuation of over a million residents in the study area was simulated using agent-based simulation built in MATSim. The agent-based modeling framework proposed in this paper provides an integrated methodology for evacuation simulation with specific consideration of agents’ behaviors. The simulation results need to be further validated and verified using real-world evacuation data.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating occupant behavior into building performance simulation models used during the design process—that is, before the actual occupants are known. It proposes the use of synthetic population data, an approach that is novel in building performance modeling although common in urban planning and public health. A simpler approach embodied in the ASHRAE Fundamentals volume is to report standard distributions of values for behavioral variables, assuming that parameters vary independently of one another when in fact many co-vary or are interdependent. An alternative approach calibrates models of occupant behavior against actual occupants in specific existing buildings, but this raises questions of transferability. Needed is a database of “generic” occupants that designers can use prospectively during the design process. This paper documents a process of combining disparate field studies of commercial buildings into a larger occupant behavior database and generating a statistically similar synthetic data set that can be shared without compromising confidentiality requirements associated with field studies. The synthetic data set successfully incorporates much of the covariance structure of the underlying field data and supports multivariate modeling. Its scope and structure necessarily serve the needs of the associated modeling framework. Cooperative and systematic sharing of data by field researchers is crucial for building large enough data sets to serve as a behaviorally-robust basis for building design.},

This paper describes an integrated simulation-based approach, modelling the EV and its interactions in both road transport and electric power systems. The main components of both systems have been considered, and the EV driver behaviour was modelled using a multi-agent simulation platform. Considering a fleet of 1000EV agents, two behavioural profiles were studied (Unaware/Aware) to model EV driver behaviour. The two behavioural profiles represent the EV driver in different stages of EV adoption starting with Unaware EV drivers when the public acceptance of EVs is limited, and developing to Aware EV drivers as the electrification of road transport is promoted in an overall context. The EV agents were modelled to follow a realistic activity-based trip pattern, and the impact of EV driver behaviour was simulated on a road transport and electricity grid. It was found that the EV agents’ behaviour has direct and indirect impact on both the road transport network and the electricity grid, affecting the traffic of the roads, the stress of the distribution network and the utilization of the charging infrastructure.},

Achieving fast execution times for these complex traffic simulations requires the parallel computing power of modern hardware. This paper presents an architectural update to the MATSim traffic simulation framework, introducing a prototype that adapts the existing traffic flow model to a distributed parallel algorithm. The prototype is capable of scaling across multiple compute nodes, utilizing the parallel computing power of modern hardware. Benchmarking reveals a 119-fold improvement in execution speed over the current implementation, and a 43 times speedup when compared to single-core performance. The prototype can simulate 24 h of large-scale traffic in just 3.5 s. Based on these results, we advocate for integrating a distributed simulation approach into MATSim and outline steps for further optimizing the prototype for large-scale applications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework to tackle the problem, which has received little attention in the literature, of adding variables to a synthetic population from aggregate data. The work herein thus enriches the existing literature by proposing a new and e icient methodology to meet this practical need. The methodology integrates three distinct stages, the first of which theoretically models the problem as a multinomial distribution. The addition of a new variable is formulated as an entropy maximization using the variables available in both the synthetic population and aggregate data. Solving this problem (in our specific case study) is not possible due to the large number of constraints involved. The second stage then presents a heuristic yielding a practical solution to the problem. This heuristic combines Bayes' theorem with the cross-entropy minimization algorithm. However, given the large number of parameters to be estimated by the proposed heuristic, some of the results obtained prove to be invalid. To rectify this shortcoming, a post-processing method is applied during a third stage to ensure the consistency of our results. The methodology is described in great detail, and examples are provided for a better understanding of these three stages. Also, this methodology is applied to a real-world case study. An income is allocated to each of the 157 000 households in the French city of Nantes based on aggregate data from the FiLoSoFi database. Income constitutes an essential microsimulation variable for taking many social and economic aspects into account (e.g. household purchasing power, redistribution policy, tax policy). Special attention is also paid to the reproducibility of our results with the databases and R-scripts used, all of which are freely available. This method remains general and is indeed applicable to other variables with available aggregate data.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the socio-economic impacts of the driving restriction zone policy for the Paris region, using the multi-agent transport simulation MATSim. Based on a previous work which has calibrated a first instantiation of the mobility model to the Paris region, we extend it by modeling and simulating two forms of intermodality: Park-and-Walk and Park-and-Ride. After re-calibrating the model, we evaluate two policy scenarios featuring different scales of the restriction zone, using indicators related to mobility, traffic emissions, and social cost. The analysis puts special attention on how modal shift and emissions vary across space, that is, inside and outside the policy zone. We find that the small-scale scenario with a restriction zone limited to the Paris center leads to very limited modal shift, whereas the larger-scale policy scenario encompassing the whole of Paris shifts significantly more trips (about 1.4\% of total trips) from cars to public transport and other modes. In both scenarios, traffic emissions decline in the restriction zone and its near surroundings. Far from the restriction zone, however, emissions increase in the small-scale scenario but decrease in the large-scale scenario. These differences are caused by the traffic detour, modal shift, and rebound effects, the magnitudes of which vary depending on the scale of the restriction zone. The driving restrictions also cause the social cost to increase by around 10\% in both scenarios. This ultimately implies a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing user costs, with a substantially greater efficiency (larger reduction for similar cost) in the large-scale policy scenario.},

	abstract = {The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners. This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals. In conclusion, despite a number of limitations, VAE constitutes a very promising methodology for generating synthetic populations, in offering practitioners numerous advantages. This paper is accompanied by a Python notebook to assist interested readers implement this new methodology.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Daily activities and mobility dynamics play a central role in the spread of COVID-19. Close physical interactions involved by certain daily activities help transmit the virus. Travel required by the spatial distribution of activities contributes to the propagation of the virus. In order to control and limit this propagation, it is critical to understand the contribution of daily activities to the dynamics of COVID-19. This paper investigates the connection between daily activities, their distribution in space and time, the characteristics of the individuals performing them, and the transmission of the virus. A business-as-usual agent-based simulation scenario of Montreal, Canada is used. To address this research question, we use two agent-based models: MATSIM and EPISIM. MATSIM simulates daily activities and mobility dynamics of the population. EPISIM simulates the spread of the virus in the population using contact networks computed by MATSIM. A synthetic population of Montreal is defined to replicate the main observed sociodemographic characteristics of Montrealers as well as their activity and mobility patterns. The definition of the synthetic population relies on various data sources: household travel survey, census, real estate, car ownership, and housing data. In the business-as-usual scenario, findings underline the significant role of home, work, and school activities in community transmission of COVID-19. Secondary activities, including leisure and shopping, also help spread the virus, but to a lesser degree in comparison with primary activities. The risk of infection in the workplace depends on the economic sector. Healthcare workers are, by far, the most exposed workers to the virus. Workplace infections mirror the gender-biased job market of Montreal. Most infections in the healthcare and educational services are among women. Most infections in the manufacturing, construction, transportation, and warehousing industries are among men. In the business-as-usual scenario where community transmission is high, primary and secondary school-aged children are found to be a major transmission vector of the virus. Finally, simulation results suggest that the risk of infection in the public transportation system is low.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, electric vehicles (EVs) have become a popular mode of individual transportation due to their significant benefits over internal combustion engine vehicles, resulting in significant growth in their penetration rate. However, the current flat electricity charging pricing and rapid diffusion of EVs may impose challenges to both transportation systems and power grids. It is well-accepted that the implementation of charging pricing schemes is a promising solution for changing and controlling EV users’ charging behavior. Nevertheless, in most research studies that have examined pricing schemes, the charging logic is defined in a way that agents will charge their vehicles while performing their daily activities. This will make the application of pricing schemes unfeasible, as agents will not have the freedom to unplug their EVs whenever they want, to reduce their billing costs. Accordingly, this paper provides an agent and activity-based framework for charging pricing schemes by decoupling activity and charging start and end times. Following this, three different charging pricing schemes have been introduced, including time of use (TOU), non-linear and zonal pricing and tested on the Montreal scenario.},

	abstract = {The accelerated adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) necessitates innovative and effective pricing strategies for charging infrastructure. This study leverages the MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) framework to meticulously evaluate the performance of two distinctive EV charging pricing models: time-based charging and a hybrid model integrating both usage-based and time-based components. Driven by the pivotal question of how EV charging should be optimally priced—whether contingent on energy consumption or charging duration—the research endeavors to conduct two simulations. These simulations aim to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis, evaluating metrics such as total power derived from grids, utility revenue, charging station queues and served vehicles. In the time-based charging scenario, EVs incur charges based on their plugged-in duration, reflecting a pricing approach that correlates directly with the time a vehicle remains connected to the charging station. In contrast, in the hybrid model, EVs undergo initial billing based on usage until a predetermined battery charge point is reached, such as achieving a full battery. Subsequently, time-based pricing takes effect until the user disconnects the vehicle. The findings indicate that, in the combined approach, utility owners have the potential to generate more revenue. Conversely, the time-based approach demonstrates a capacity to serve a higher number of electric EVs, with comparable queue lengths observed in both approaches. Importantly, using the results of this paper, policymakers can suggest pricing schemes that maximize benefits for utility owners, reduce queues at charging stations, and ensure the security of power grids.},

	abstract = {A major part of urban private vehicles needs to be electrified in order to meet the German climate protection goals in the transport sector. Therefore, charging strategies must be developed and the geographical distribution of infrastructure has to be planned accordingly. We propose a new method to combine a multi agent traffic simulation (MATSim) with real-world vehicle distribution and measured charging behavior. The results of our simulation were analyzed for the exemplary use case of Berlin’s private passenger cars. Three different charging strategies were developed and analyzed: charging at home, at work and during leisure activities. Charging at home was suitable to serve all agents’ charging demand with low charging power (7.4 kW). Charging at work only served 56.23 \% of the agents with a charging power of 11 kW, but required fewer charging points. Charging during leisure activities served from 46.36 \% to 81.92 \% of the agents, depending on the chosen charging power and user behavior.},

	abstract = {The execution of agent-based microsimulation requires an initial set of agents with detailed socioeconomic and demographic attributes to support subsequent behavioral and market models. Data limitations and privacy reasons often restrict the scope and detail with which a synthetic population can be generated by the traditional population synthesis approach. For the accommodation of the growing requirement of microsimulation on spatial resolution and variety, considering new data sources that overcome the data limitations and support population synthesis at more disaggregated levels is necessary. This paper presents a two-stage population synthesis approach not only to improve the accuracy of population generation with imperfect microdata and marginal data, but also to use additional data sets when the spatial details of the synthetic population are interpolated. A general iterative proportional fitting (IPF) method is used in the first stage to estimate the joint distribution of household and individual characteristics under multiple levels of constraints. Additional building information is collected from multiple sources and used to estimate spatial patterns of housing and household characteristics that are then preserved through a second IPF procedure. Preliminary tests of the proposed two-stage IPF-based approach with Singapore data show that the method yields better fitted population realizations at more fine-grained levels than do traditional one-step population synthesis methods.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of the e-commerce market leads us to expect a further increase in delivery vehicles in urban areas as well. This growth is expected to be accompanied by an increase in emissions while space becomes scarce. Meanwhile, people are adjusting their travel behaviour; therefore, the growing e-commerce market affects both last-mile delivery and private passenger traffic. Failed home deliveries are an important factor. They produce additional traffic by both ”Courier, Express and Parcel” (CEP) service providers and private passengers in the form of repeated delivery attempts or trips to pick up parcels. In this paper we apply an integrated agent-based model of last-mile deliveries and private travel demand. This allows for analysis of interactions between delivery and private passenger traffic and the status of the recipients during delivery. Furthermore, we present a neighbourship model to account for deliveries accepted by neighbours, which is crucial to reproduce realistic delivery success rates. We applied the presented model to the city of Karlsruhe, Germany, and simulated multiple delivery policy scenarios, which we compare to a static model without interactions between private and delivery agents. Our results show that the agent-based model produces more nuanced success rates with respect to different socio-demographic groups. Differentiating these groups is necessary when assessing measures that target specific groups and analysing effects of demographic changes. Also, we show the necessity of considering neighbours in such a model. This paper provides insight into the effects of e-commerce on a transport system and a framework to analyse policy measures or alternative delivery strategies.},

	abstract = {Recently, a substantial increase in parcel volumes has been observable, primarily shipped by courier, express, and parcel service providers (CEPSPs). Especially in urban areas, existing space conflicts are intensified, while emissions are steadily rising due to the higher need of parcel transportation. From a regional planning perspective, understanding the net effect of increased parcel volumes is essential for transportation planning and policies, for which freight demand models are commonly used. Existing models primarily focus on parcel deliveries to private customers, although parcel shipments to and from companies considerably contribute to the overall parcel volumes. Hence, this study aims to develop an agent-based model that explicitly represents the in- and outgoing parcel volumes of companies in urban areas delivered by CEPSPs. An approach based on Open Data and self-conducted expert interviews with CEPSPs is developed. First, OpenStreetMap data is used to geographically represent companies with the corresponding sector assignment within a study area in Karlsruhe, Germany. Second, a concept for modeling the weekly in- and outgoing parcel volume for each company in the study area is developed using literature-based data. The approach is integrated into the existing agent-based framework logiTopp considering all relevant CEPSPs of the respective area. The application shows that modeling CEP-based transportation volumes of companies based on Open Data is possible though restrictions apply to the granularity of the used data. However, potential is seen in generating a well-funded empirical database of companies’ in- and outgoing parcel demand structures to improve the model further.},

However, the existing simulation models for e-commerce demand are still limited and do not consider the impacts of delivery options and their attributes that shoppers face on multiple dimensions of e-commerce demand. We propose a novel framework involving disaggregate behavioral models that jointly predict e-commerce expenditure, purchase amount per transaction, delivery mode, and option choices. The proposed framework can simulate the changes in e-commerce demand and be used to evaluate the impacts of a range of policies and solutions. We specify the model parameters based on various sources of relevant information, integrate the model into an urban freight simulator, and conduct a demonstrative simulation for a prototypical North American city. The results of the analysis highlight the capability and applicability of the proposed modeling framework.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the role of freight transportation and parcel delivery in urban areas has increased, supporting the economic and social development of cities. At the same time, the industry is affected by various issues, inefficiencies, and externalities, particularly in the last-mile segment. As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors’ business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas. Finally, the decision support system is tested using real data of the city of Turin.},

	abstract = {Trip-based models and activity-based models represent two extreme ends of the spectrum of travel demand models in data granularity requirement and ability to reflect the underlying motivation to travel. Modelling of representative freight activity-travel patterns (RFAPs) has the potential to serve as the bridge between these approaches. RFAP clusters represent homogeneous groups of establishments, where utility maximization models predict the probability that an establishment belongs to a particular cluster. However, it is still an open question how to define, interpret and model activity-travel patterns in the context of freight system. To answer this question, this study conducted a large-scale establishment-based freight survey (EBFS) in seven cities of India and resulted in a sample of 432 establishments and their 1613 shipment records. In the first part, this paper proposes a novel approach for identifying RFAPs based on the notion that “activities” that inspire trip-making for passenger is equivalent to “freight orders” in the case of establishments. The cluster analyses revealed the presence of three well separated main clusters and nine less separated nested clusters. Through interpretation and labelling of these RFAPs, freight travel market is categorized into useful segments. The results suggested that a priori industrial classification systems used in trip-based models are overly simplified representations of the complex structure of the travel patterns. In the last part, freight activity-travel pattern generation (FAPG) models are developed which predicts the probability that an establishment exhibits a particular RFAP. The FAPG models developed using these RFAPs could replace the traditional freight generation (FG) and freight trip generation (FTG) models due to its ability to convert the assigned activity-patterns to trips or tonnage. For example, FAPG model suggest that at an employment level of 120, there is a 56\% probability that establishments will exhibit MDV-HFMH (medium duty vehicles - high frequency medium haul) pattern which, in turn, implies that FP = 1630 tons/year; shipment frequency, i.e., FTP = 8 trips/week; length of haul = 240.6 km and commercial vehicle type choice = MDV. Thus, FAPG models can present an enhanced representation of freight flows since both FG and FTG are jointly modeled in this approach. That is, the best features of both commodity-based modelling (i.e., ability to capture the fundamental mechanism that drives freight demand) and vehicle-based modelling (i.e., ability to capture freight traffic implications) are included in FAPG models. The study findings are expected to assist in identifying the variations in establishments’ preferences so that it is possible to identify the type of transport supply improvements that the establishments will respond to accurately, and thus prioritize the infrastructure investments. Moreover, the discussions on these findings are expected to improve the behavioral and spatial foundations of traditional freight models.},

	abstract = {Ever-growing urban areas and global population movement towards urbanization lead to major concerns regarding urban logistics and last mile operations. In Latin America, the problem becomes critical since volatile emerging economies and unstable political situations, which are common in the region, introduce additional limitations for strong logistics solutions. In the city of Quito (Ecuador), traffic regulations only consider time-schedule restrictions for vehicle mobility without any other policies that benefit urban goods movement. This is in part because there is a lack of knowledge on freight flows, mainly related to the difficulties to retrieve data to that purpose. This paper proposes a freight trip generation analysis in Quito, based on a methodology included in “MIT’s Better Cities for Logistics Toolkit”, which defines specific zones observation and data collection campaigns. More precisely, a procedure combining observation-based and declarative data collection processes is proposed. First, the opportunities of combining both observed and declared data to characterize freight trip generation are addressed on the basis of a literature review. Main issues of combining establishment based surveys and observations are addressed to generalize the proposed framework. Finally, application implications in a transferability perspective to other Latin American countries are addressed.},

	title = {A review of the freight generation models and data collection techniques},
	abstract = {With the rapid development of the world economy after the Industrial Revolution, the freight transportation sector has evolved drastically worldwide. Both rural and urban roads of different developed and developing countries have seen a rapid rise in freight traffic movement. Transportation engineers and planners have been predicting present and future freight traffic movements to cope with the increasing demand. However, unlike four-step passenger transportation trip modelling, freight transport modelling steps include a variety of complexities. This includes the involvement of several stakeholders, variations in types of goods, and complex freight delivery systems in urban setups, among others. To encounter the complexities above, freight transport researchers must carefully consider different modelling techniques and relevant data collection processes for different economies, goods, shipment types, geographical areas, etc. This review paper aims to systematically analyze the existing body of literature on freight generation and freight trip generation models and associated data collection techniques across the world, focusing on evaluating their effectiveness, comparability, and real-world applicability. From a wide range of literature, we have meticulously analyzed 35 papers worldwide, including some developing economies, to understand the existing world and emerging trends in freight generation modelling and data collection techniques. The paper identifies strengths, limitations, and gaps in current research through a rigorous analysis of various methodologies, from traditional regression-based models to machine learning algorithms and data collection methods like commodity flow surveys, establishment surveys, carrier surveys, roadside surveys, GPS tracking and administrative records. Additionally, it highlights emerging trends and challenges such as data accuracy, privacy issues, and the integration of real-time analytics. Practical recommendations are offered for both practitioners and policymakers. This study is a comprehensive guide for future research and application in freight transportation planning.},

	abstract = {Several findings call into question current practices. The chief conclusion is that the accuracy of freight generation (FG) and freight trip generation (FTG) models depends on the consistency between the model's structure and actual FG-FTG patterns, the degree of internal heterogeneity of the economic and land use aggregation used to estimate the model, and the appropriateness of the spatial aggregation procedure used to obtain the desired FG-FTG estimates. Relative to model structure, the paper establishes strong reasons to treat FG and FTG as separate concepts, because the latter is the output of logistic decisions, whereas the former is determined by the economics of production and consumption. The connection between business size variables?for example, employment?and FG is relatively strong because they are economic input factors, whereas the one with FTG is weaker because inventory and transportation costs come into play. Thus it is generally not correct to assume proportionality between FTG and business size or to assume that using constant FTG rates could be problematic. For instance, only 18\% of the industry sectors in New York City exhibit constant FTG rates per employee. For economic and land use aggregation, the finer the level of detail the better, as independent variables have a better chance to explain FG-FTG. In the case of spatial aggregation, the correct aggregation procedure depends on the underlying disaggregate model. For a FG-FTG model to work well, both economic and land use and spatial aggregations must be appropriate.},

The aim is to achieve better freight trip generation models, thus contributing to improving the chances of correctly dimension, for example, the parking infrastructure required to accommodate demand, or estimating the freight traffic impacts at micro level. Representing the state of the practice, the first two methodologies are based on cross-classification/category analysis. The third methodology uses a generalized linear model specification, a robust alternative to ordinary least squares linear regression. The fourth methodology consists in the exploration of a dependent variable simplification using an Ordinal Logit model. The main source of data is an Establishment-based Freight Survey, which collected data from 604 retail establishments in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The selected independent variables were the establishments’ industry category, number of employees and retail area. The analysis allowed for the conclusion that (a) variable contribution varies depending on the chosen modelling methodology, (b) there is little variability in the quality of predictions depending on the selected model, but a considerable improvement in correct predictions can be achieved by reducing the variability of the dependent variable, and (c) the proposed indicator framework is suitable to compare model predictions and might be adequately represented by subset of those applied.},

After the key premises that should guide the development of FTG models have been presented, the paper assesses transferability in two ways. The first is through analyses of how well representative FTG models are able to estimate the actual FTG for a number of external validation cases. The second is through FTG econometric models that assess the statistical significance of binary variables that represent specific geographic locations. In addition, the paper introduces and assesses the accuracy of a synthetic correction procedure that is intended to improve the transfer-ability and quality of the estimates provided by the FTG rates available in the literature. The results show that the models developed as part of the National Cooperative Freight Research Program's Project 25, Freight Trip Generation and Land Use, have better prediction capabilities than the models included in other compilations. In addition, the synthetic correction procedures improve transferability, and no locational effects are present in the test data.},

	abstract = {When vehicle routing decisions are intertwined with higher-level decisions, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges for computation. Examples are the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), where customers are assigned to depots before delivery, and the capacitated location routing problem (CLRP), where the locations of depots should be determined first. A simple and straightforward approach for such hierarchical problems would be to separate the higher-level decisions from the complicated vehicle routing decisions. For each higher-level decision candidate, we may evaluate the underlying vehicle routing problems to assess the candidate. As this approach requires solving vehicle routing problems multiple times, it has been regarded as impractical in most cases. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach called the genetic algorithm with neural cost predictor to tackle the challenge and simplify algorithm developments. For each higher-level decision candidate, we predict the objective function values of the underlying vehicle routing problems using a pretrained graph neural network without actually solving the routing problems. In particular, our proposed neural network learns the objective values of the HGS-CVRP open-source package that solves capacitated vehicle routing problems. Our numerical experiments show that this simplified approach is effective and efficient in generating high-quality solutions for both MDVRP and CLRP and that it has the potential to expedite algorithm developments for complicated hierarchical problems. We provide computational results evaluated in the standard benchmark instances used in the literature.

It is based on a long-term survey of home deliveries in a large residential apartment building that tracks daily parcel deliveries by carrier. Empirical evidence from this delivery point survey is used to substantiate retail digitalization trends, which have resulted in changes in the distribution pattern with the growth of home deliveries. The growth of the delivery footprint in terms of the space consumed by parcels within buildings waiting to be picked up by their consignees is becoming evident. Further, major online retailers are undertaking vertical integration strategies, such as having their own delivery arrangements, which is reflected in the shift in the relative share of carriers used for home deliveries. The survey provided concrete trends in terms of temporal frequency of deliveries on an annual, weekly, daily, and hourly scale.},

Online shopping behavior is modeled using logistic and Poisson regression models, which consider both the socio-demographic characteristics of the customer and aspects of their travel behavior. As mobiTopp is a framework that simulates travel demand over one week, we are able to capture interactions between travel behavior and online shopping that do not become apparent in single-day simulations. The results show that the integrated choice model reflects the findings presented in the literature in that male, affluent, young professionals are most likely to (frequently) order parcels online compared to other groups of the population. Application of the agent-based model to a city in Germany shows that socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics are considered realistically within the simulation. The model presented here is a suitable simulation tool for alternative urban last-mile delivery solutions, and the open-source and modular framework allows for transfer to other regions as the underlying choice models are consistent with literature from other spatial contexts. The findings are of interest to transportation planners and policymakers as they contribute to the understanding of how increased e-commerce demand influences the transportation system and solutions to mitigate adverse effects.},

	abstract = {City logistics plays a central role in supplying and disposing goods for establishments and residents in urban areas. However, the steadily rising demand for transporting goods puts cities under pressure. Hence, municipalities strive for alternative solutions for urban freight transport, especially parcel shipments on the first and last mile. Freight demand models are suitable to evaluate the transport-related effects of such solutions. However, developing those models requires a sufficient amount of data, which, to date, especially for establishments, cannot be covered in its necessary scope and accuracy by publicly available sources. Although parcel shipments to and from establishments make up to 40 \% of the overall courier, express, and parcel market, these are often neglected in existing modelling approaches. Hence, in this study, we present a data collection concept for generating highly relevant data for the microscopic modelling of urban freight, i.e., parcel transport focusing on establishments. To reflect transport demand (i.e., establishments that need to have goods shipped) and transport supply (i.e., carriers that provide a transport service), a mixed-method approach is developed comprising complementary components. On the one hand, an online establishment survey is designed aiming to reveal disaggregated transport demand data for the subsequent modelling process. The survey focuses on the delivery and shipment characteristics of goods, such as temporal and spatial demand patterns. On the other hand, expert interviews are conceptualized to identify relevant patterns of transport supply carriers such as courier, express, and parcel service providers and shall further work as secondary data for the modelling process. The approach is applied in the region of Karlsruhe, Germany. It can be shown that the survey is generally suitable for generating freight transport data on a disaggregated level and that the mixed-method approach is capable of mutually validating the data obtained. However, our approach also emphasizes the necessity to conduct an establishment survey as a personal rather than a self-reporting interview, even if the costs are higher.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the transferability of freight generation (FG) models to provide guidance on the direction of transfer, the degree of transfer, and how to determine the sample size required for new regions. A set of FG models are developed for four regions in India, i.e., Hyderabad, Jaipur, North Kerala, and Central Kerala. Models are assessed for naïve transferability across these regions to know the direction and degree of transfer. Using multidimensionality scaling, we identified new regions similar to the study regions based on geographical characteristics like population density, number of establishments, land value, road density, and seaport proximity. The identical regions are further grouped into four different clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm. In order to determine the sample size of a new region, the transferability results are interpolated to these geographically linked regions with the same demographics. This research is crucial for saving survey resources in terms of money and time. The policymakers and stakeholders can borrow the strategies already under implementation in a region with topographic similarity with the novel methodology proposed. Furthermore, industrialists can take the case study of the establishments in geographically similar regions in strategizing the resource and capacity allocation for efficient and responsive supply chain design.},

Moreover, this work aims to equip the readers with a guide on best practices inspired by the computer science domain, templates for documentation of software and data, and guidelines on repository management and open source. The empirical analysis of more than 11,879 simulation studies and 672 repositories in the field reveals that only few works (less than 2\%) share supplementary material alongside the scientific publication, on a mostly mediocre repository quality, but with a strong trend towards more transparency in the last years. Besides, simulation studies with enhanced transparency are found to not receive significantly more citations when compared with studies that do not provide additional repositories. What’s more, a survey of more than 87 transportation researchers conveys that reproducibility is perceived as a significant issue by the community, and that time and legal constraints are the largest impediments to more reproducible research.},

	abstract = {The technological advance of electrochemical energy storage and the electric powertrain has led to rapid growth in the deployment of electric vehicles. The high cost and the added weight of the batteries have limited the size (energy storage capacity) and, therefore, the driving range of these vehicles. However, consumers are steadily purchasing these vehicles because of the fast acceleration, quiet ride, and high energy efficiency. The higher pack-to-wheel efficiency and the lower energy cost per mile, as well as the lower expense for maintenance and repair, translate to operating savings over conventional vehicles. This paper compares battery electric vehicles with internal combustion engine vehicles based on the total cost of ownership. It is seen that the higher initial cost of electric vehicles can be recovered in as little as 5 years. This is especially true for electric vehicles with shorter driving ranges. Specifically, a vehicle with an electric driving range under 200 miles may achieve cost parity with an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle in 8 years or less.},

	abstract = {Last-mile deliveries usually occur within urban areas where logistics operations increase congestion and emissions, as well as associated roadway-related health impacts. This paper evaluates the role of incentives for zero and near-zero emission vehicle (ZEV) technologies in last-mile delivery operations. Specifically, the study investigates the total cost of ownership and life cycle environmental impacts associated with last-mile deliveries, and compares the private and public costs of different vehicle powertrain and fuel pathways, under existing incentives in the State of California. The study analyzes driving patterns for several last-mile delivery vocations, including beverage, warehouse, parcel, grocery, food and local deliveries based on real-world truck travel data. Statistical analyses are conducted to compare driving patterns across vocations, vehicle classes, and powertrains, as well as across parcel carrier fleets. To better assess the role of the incentives, the study also provides a comparative estimate of the marginal health damages from life cycle emissions of criteria pollutants (e.g. \$/ton). Our results suggest that parcel deliveries are characterized by short trips (95\% less than 100 miles), a high number of stops, and lower average driving speeds compared to other delivery vocations. Total cost of ownership for conventional diesel Class 3 to 6 vehicles used in last mile applications were estimated to be approximately between \$282 and \$305 thousand dollars, with the cost of negative health impacts ranging from \$38 to \$64 thousand dollars over the vehicle lifetime. The results show that battery electric freight vehicles are cost competitive with conventional diesel vehicles, particularly for smaller (Class 3) light commercial vehicles. Available financial incentives were sufficient to offset additional purchase and fuel expenses, leading to lower total costs of ownership.},

	abstract = {We introduce an electric vehicle routing problem combining conventional, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are constrained in their service range by their battery capacity, and may require time-consuming recharging operations at some specific locations. Plug-in hybrid vehicles have two engines, an internal combustion engine and an electric engine using a built-in rechargeable battery. These vehicles can avoid visits to recharging stations by switching to fossil fuel. However, this flexibility comes at the price of a generally higher consumption rate and utility cost. To solve this complex problem variant, we design a sophisticated metaheuristic which combines a genetic algorithm with local and large neighborhood search. All route evaluations, within the approach, are based on a layered optimization algorithm which combines labeling techniques and greedy evaluation policies to insert recharging stations visits in a fixed trip and select the fuel types. The metaheuristic is finally hybridized with an integer programming solver, over a set partitioning formulation, so as to recombine high-quality routes from the search history into better solutions. Extensive experimental analyses are conducted, highlighting the good performance of the algorithm and the contribution of each of its main components. Finally, we investigate the impact of fuel and energy cost on fleet composition decisions. Our experiments show that a careful use of a mixed fleet can significantly reduce operational costs in a large variety of price scenarios, in comparison with the use of a fleet composed of a single vehicle class.},

The deliveries in dense cities cause several serious issues such as air/noise pollution and congestion. In this study, we compare the financial costs and CO2 emissions from different last mile delivery strategies of grocery bins in a scenario in Paris with four types of delivery vehicles (diesel/electric vans, cargo bikes, and autonomous delivery vehicles). We use costs associated with each vehicle type, location data with constraints for establishments in Paris, and delivery scenarios obtained by solving the vehicle routing problem for an overall cost comparison. We consider an economic analysis of the daily delivery to optimise the costs and estimate the CO2 emissions. The results highlight the competitiveness among last mile delivery and reflect the transition knowing the transport expenses since 2018: electric van costs become competitive with diesel ones, it concluded by some perspectives with cargo bikes and autonomous vehicles with their current limits. The strategies show a great impact on overall cost and emissions, which are vital in the development of sustainable urban last-mile delivery.},

Substantial uncertainty remains regarding potential price trajectories and their underlying drivers. In light of this, we explore EU ETS 2 price paths using the energy system model PRIMES. We focus on the effect of complementary efficiency policies (EPs), as earlier research suggests they could have a profound impact. Indeed, analyzing three scenarios with different EPs stringency, we find that they make EU ETS 2 prices vary between 71 EUR/tCO2 and 261 EUR/tCO2 in 2030. Despite different instruments driving emission abatement, comparable emission reductions at the EU level (−41\%) are achieved in all three scenarios.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2401.00093},
	abstract = {The rapid growth of the ride-hailing industry has revolutionized urban transportation worldwide. Despite its benefits, equity concerns arise as underserved communities face limited accessibility to affordable ride-hailing services. A key issue in this context is the vehicle rebalancing problem, where idle vehicles are moved to areas with anticipated demand. Without equitable approaches in demand forecasting and rebalancing strategies, these practices can further deepen existing inequities. In the realm of ride-hailing, three main facets of fairness are recognized: algorithmic fairness, fairness to drivers, and fairness to riders. This paper focuses on enhancing both algorithmic and rider fairness through a novel vehicle rebalancing method. We introduce an approach that combines a Socio-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SA-STGCN) for refined demand prediction and a fairness-integrated Matching-Integrated Vehicle Rebalancing (MIVR) model for subsequent vehicle rebalancing. Our methodology is designed to reduce prediction discrepancies and ensure equitable service provision across diverse regions. The effectiveness of our system is evaluated using simulations based on real-world ride-hailing data. The results suggest that our proposed method enhances both accuracy and fairness in forecasting ride-hailing demand, ultimately resulting in more equitable vehicle rebalancing in subsequent operations. Specifically, the algorithm developed in this study effectively reduces the standard deviation and average customer wait times by 6.48\% and 0.49\%, respectively. This achievement signifies a beneficial outcome for ride-hailing platforms, striking a balance between operational efficiency and fairness.},
