My research interest lies in the replicable use and development of highly disaggregated simulations of complex socio-technical systems with a focus on transportation and mobility. Key aspects of my work is the advancement of methods for the generation of **synthetic populations** and the development of **agent-based simulations**. My overarching goal is to design, develop, and maintain the respective **open-source** tools and strongly foster the use of **open data** to ensure **reproducibility** in research and practice.

- **Synthetic populations** are detailed digital representations (digital twins) of a territory's population, including households and persons with sociodemographic attributes such as income, age, and gender, as well as spatial attributes such as their place of residence. Furthermore, synthetic populations provide representative *activity chains* which describes what type of activity, at what time, and at which place a synthetic persons is likely to to on an average day. **I am the author of the [eqasim-synpop](https://eqasim.org/) framework** that allows generating synthetic population data sets based entirely on open data for France and a couple of other use cases.

- **Agent-based simulations** of the transport system take synthetic populations as input and simulate the persons' movements between their daily activities. This way, traffic patterns of the real world can be replicated. In a second step, the simulations are used to assess the impact of new technologies, transport policies, and societal changes - on the system or individual (by place of residence, age, ...) level. I am an **active maintainer** of the agent-based transport simulation framework **[MATSim](http://matsim.org)** and its **[eqasim-java](https://eqasim.org/) extension**.

Since 2020 I am **Senior Researcher at [IRT SystemX](https://irt-systemx.fr/)**, a private-public research institute in Paris. Furthermore, I am **invited researcher** at **[Universit√© Gustave Eiffel](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/)** and the **[GRETTIA](https://grettia.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr)** laboratory. Previously, I obtained my PhD at the Institute for Transport Planning and Systems at **ETH Zurich**.
